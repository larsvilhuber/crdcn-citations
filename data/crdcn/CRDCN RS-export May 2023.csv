Les résultats des analyses menées sur un échantillon de 3771 télétravailleurs canadiens ont révélé que le travail à distance a engendré des demandes additionnelles telles que l’interdépendance des tâches et l’isolement professionnel. Ces demandes ont eu des effets négatifs sur la performance en télétravail en augmentant la fréquence du stress perçu. Toutefois, la présence de ressources telles que le soutien organisationnel semble jouer un rôle tampon en modérant l’effet direct de l’isolement professionnel sur la performance en télétravail.

In this study, we determined whether living near a hospital distorts the association between living in favourable ALEs and hospitalization for physical inactivity-related cardiometabolic diseases. We used a record linkage of 442,345 respondents of the Canadian Community Health Survey and their hospitalization records for cardiometabolic disease. We then assessed respondents’ neighbourhoods using the Canadian Active Living Environments measure (Can-ALE), a measure based on ≥3-way intersection density, residential density, and points of interest. We then calculated the distance in kilometers between the centroids of respondents’ assigned dissemination areas and the nearest user-contributed location for hospitals from OpenStreetMap. We monitored changes in estimates for the association between ALEs and odds of cardiometabolic disease hospitalization using a series of logistic regressions with indicator variables for distances to hospital of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. We found that living between 500 meters and six kilometers of a hospital and was associated with modestly higher odds of cardiometabolic hospitalization (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18 for 500 meters; OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09 for six kilometers). Living in more favourable ALEs was associated with lower odds of hospitalization (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.91; comparing the most favourable to least favourable ALEs).

The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep–physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g., inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size.

Unfortunately, the number of paratransit users, in most cities, is rapidly growing while resources remain limited. Paratransit is one of the rare public transport services that are adapted to the needs of users with disabilities. Still, it may be possible to shift some paratransit trips to the RTN (regular transit network). The aim of this paper is to develop and test criteria to identify paratransit trips that could be shifted to the RTN with the best potential of success. Methods Four criteria are proposed to identify these trips. 1) The autonomy level of paratransit users: they must be able to use the RTN by themselves. 2) The universal design of each metro station, bus stop and vehicle. 3) The spatial location of both origin and destination of the trips and their proximity to the RTN, to avoid long walking/rolling distances. 4) The frequency of the trips: how many times over a year does a user performs a specific trip. We propose a method to evaluate these criteria. Results These four criteria allow prioritizing paratransit trips that could be shifted the RTN with the most potential of success. With these criteria, the safety and the satisfaction of users could be maintained while reducing operation costs of paratransit services. The method has been applied to the paratransit trips of the STM (Montreal Transit Authority) and 15% (400,000 trips) of them could be shifted to the RTN in short term. Conclusion This research is a step forward to shift paratransit trips to RTN. Still, the proposed criteria need to be refined and more criteria could be added to improve the prioritization of most promising paratransit trips. Nevertheless, the application of this methodology can assist stakeholders in making choices about the mobility services for PWDs.",2022-03-01,2023-04-06 13:39:02,2023-04-06 13:39:02,2023-04-06 13:39:02,101338,,,24,,Journal of Transport & Health,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\R3UA4M5D\Garnier et al. - 2022 - Criteria to prioritize opportunities to shift para.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\EK7PWPVU\S221414052200010X.html,,,Paratransit; People with disabilities; Transit services; Trips transferability; Universal design; Walkability/wheelability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Une estimation en triples différences utilisant les données de l’Enquête sur la population active (EPA) du Canada montre que le choc d’offre de main d’oeuvre a fait baisser le salaire horaire de 7,6% chez les nouveaux diplômés universitaires, ce qui corrobore le résultat obtenu par les données du Recensement du Canada.

Recent literature calls for the study of migration at the household level and for the consideration of care needs among the determinants of migration. Based on the case of Vietnam, this article contributes to past research by providing a longitudinal analysis of how household care needs may influence the use of internal migration as a livelihood strategy. Using a household life-course perspective that recognizes how family care needs evolve over time, this article tests if care needs influence the propensity for a household to have one or more new member-out-migrants over time. We operationalize care needs through the household dependency ratio, health care and education expenditures. Multivariate analyses are based on longitudinal data from three passages of the Vietnam Living Standards Survey of 2010, 2012, and 2014. Results indicate that households needing to cover costs of children’s education are more likely to engage in migration than those with health care needs. These results reinforce the idea that migration requires certain conditions to occur and that the immediate care needs that require co-presence tend to prevent, rather than incite, migration at the household level.

Neighbourhoods characterized by a high proportion of fast-food outlets may contribute to hypertension in residents; however, limited research has explored these associations. The objectives of this study were to assess associations between neighbourhood fast-food environments, measured and self-reported hypertension. ApproachWe used data from 10,700 adults who participated in six cycles of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). Measured hypertension was defined as having an average systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥140, a diastolic BP&nbsp; ≥90 mm Hg or being on BP lowering medication. Participants were also asked if they had been diagnosed with high BP or if they take BP lowering medication (i.e., self-reported hypertension). We characterized the fast-food environment of each participant’s neighbourhood using the Canadian Food Environment Dataset (Can-FED). We considered the proportion of fast-food outlets relative to fast-food outlets and full-service restaurants as a continuous variable. ResultsThe mean proportion of fast-food outlets was 23.3% (SD 26.8%). A one standard deviation (SD) increase in the proportion to fast-food outlets was associated with higher odds of measured hypertension in the full sample (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31) and in sex-specific models (women: OR=1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29; and men: OR=1.21, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.43). A one standard deviation (SD) increase in the proportion to fast-food outlets was associated with higher odds of self-reported hypertension in the full sample (OR=1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.24); however, associations were inconclusive in sex-specific models (women: OR=1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.26; and men: OR=1.14, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.33).

Despite extensive knowledge on ultraviolet radiation's (UVR) detrimental impact, many still fail to implement sun protection/sun avoidance. Human behavior, attitudes, and cultural norms of individuals and communities heavily depend on the surrounding climate/environment. In many instances, the climate shapes the culture/norms of the society. Canada has vast geographic/environmental differences. Methods In the current ecological study, we sought to examine the relationship between various geographic and environmental factors and the distribution of CM incidence by Forward Sortation Area (FSA) postal code across Canada. CM incidence data were extracted from the Canadian Cancer Registry, while environmental data were extracted from the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (greenspace, as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index; annual highest temperature; absolute number and average length of yearly heat events; annual total precipitation [rain and snow]; absolute number and average length of events with precipitation [rain and snow]; and summer UVR index). The above geographic/environmental data by FSA were correlated with the respective CM incidence employing negative binomial regression model. Results Our analysis highlights that increases in annual average temperature, summer UVR, and greenspace were associated with higher expected incidence of CM cases, while higher number of annual heat events together with highest annual temperature and higher average number of annual rain events were associated with a decrease in CM incidence rate. This study also highlights regional variation in environmental CM risk factors in Canada.

Both Wales UK and Canada have advanced data infrastructure that allows record linkage between survey data and administrative health information. Objective To assess the relationship between ALEs and hospitalization in Wales and Canada. Methods We performed a population-based comparison using individual-level survey data from the Welsh Health Survey (N = 9968) linked to the Patient Episode Database for Wales, and the Canadian Community Health Survey (N = 40,335) linked to the Discharge Abstract Database. Using equivalent protocols and open-source data for street networks, destinations, and residential density, we derived 5-class measures of the ALE for Wales and Canada (classed 1 through 5, considered least favourable to most favourable for active living, respectively). We evaluated relationships of ALEs to health, behaviours and hospitalization using multivariate regression (reference group was the lowest ALE class 1, considered least favourable for active living). Results For Canada, those living in the highest ALE class 5 had lower odds of all-cause hospitalization (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.81; as compared to the lowest ALE class 1). In contrast, those living in the highest ALE class 5 in Wales had higher odds of all-cause hospitalization (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.80). The relationship between ALEs and cardiometabolic hospitalization was inconclusive for Canada (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12), but we observed higher odds of cardiometabolic hospitalization for respondents living in higher ALE classes for Wales (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.78; comparing ALE class 4 to ALE class 1). Conclusion Canadian respondents living in high ALE neighbourhoods that are understood to be favourable for active living had lower odds of all-cause hospitalization, whereas Welsh respondents living in high ALEs that were deemed favourable for active living exhibited higher odds of all-cause hospitalization.

Content validity, internal construct validity and internal consistency reliability of the six disorder subscales were assessed. Structural equation modelling was used to assess measurement invariance, internal and external convergent and discriminant validity. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed unidimensionality of subscales and adequate item-fit to all scales. Measurement equivalence was demonstrated fully for four subscales and partially for two. Internal consistency reliability for all subscales exceeded 0.78, except for the conduct disorder scale in 12- to 13-year-olds. Evidence of internal convergent validity was demonstrated in all cases.

This study examines whether Canadians’ prescription drug coverage status is associated with their health services use and how this association differs by gender across non-migrants and three categories of migrants: economic immigrants, family-class immigrants, and refugees. Very few studies have examined differences across these migrant groups, and there is a need to do so as they experience varying health disparities. This study contributes to the prescription drug coverage, migration and health literature by employing an intersectional lens to analyze a sample of Ontario working-aged residents (n=39,792) generated from linking the Canadian Community Health Survey (2005, 2008, 2013, 2014) and Longitudinal Immigrant Database. Predicted probabilities and average marginal effects from multivariable logistic regression models were generated, and interaction effects between prescription drug coverage and immigrant status were examined. The study reveals important differences in the use of health services across prescription drug coverage groups by immigration status. As the general debate about universal pharmacare in Canada is ongoing, this study reveals that drug insurance is positively associated with health services use of most migrants and non-migrants, however, some immigrant women may still experience barriers to access general practitioner services.

Methods Secondary analyses were conducted for each birth cohort. Risk ratios, pooled risk estimates, and absolute inequality, measured by the Slope Index of Inequality (SII), were estimated to quantify social gradients in ADHD during late childhood by household income and maternal education measured during early childhood. Estimates were adjusted for child sex, mother age at birth, mother ethnicity, and multiple births. Findings All cohorts demonstrated social gradients by household income and maternal education in early childhood, except for maternal education in Quebec. Pooled risk estimates, relating to 44,925 children, yielded expected gradients (income: low 1.83(CI 1.38,2.41), middle 1.42(1.13,1.79), high (reference); maternal education: low 2.13(1.39,3.25), middle 1.42(1.13,1.79)). Estimates of absolute inequality using SII showed that the largest differences in ADHD prevalence between the highest and lowest levels of maternal education were observed in Australia (4% lower) and Sweden (3% lower); for household income, the largest differences were observed in Quebec (6% lower) and Canada (all provinces: 5% lower). Conclusion Findings indicate that children in families with high household income or maternal education are less likely to have ADHD at age 9–11. Absolute inequality, in combination with relative inequality, provides a more complete account of the socioeconomic status and ADHD relationship in different high-income countries.

This study aimed to (1) propose and test a framework to search for stages of representative components and determine stages of stability and transition, (2) identify stages of biological development based on health questionnaire and biomarker data, and (3) interpret the major trajectories in a health and biomarker database.MethodsThis study analyzed the data on the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) interviewees from cycle 1 to 3 (2007–2013) in Canada. We selected 282 variables containing information from questionnaire and on biomarkers after removing redundant variables based on high correlation. Fifty-nine nominal variables were replaced by 122 binominal variables, leaving 345 variables for analysis. Principal component (PC) analysis was conducted to summarize the data and the loadings were used to interpret the PCs. A stable stage was assumed to be the age groups without significantly different values of PCs.ResultsThe CHMS interviewed 16,340 Canadians. Of all, 51.25% were female. The age ranged from 6 to 79 years (mean = 34.41 years, 95% CI = 34.74–34.08). The proportions of total variance explained by the first three PCs were 12.14, 4.03, and 3.19%, respectively. The differences of the first PC were not significant, especially between age 22 and 33, 34 and 40, 41 and 45, 46 and 71, and 72 and 79 years (adjusted p > 0.05 for all). The leading variable, in terms of the variance contributed to PC1, was time spent in physical activities, followed by variables related to alcohol consumption, and smoking. The 13 leading contributors to PC2 variances were all lung function measures.Discussion and conclusionThere are stages of stability and transition across all age groups based on the first PCs. The first and second PCs are related to physical development and lung function. The identification of stable stages is the first step to understanding how human biology develops in a population perspective and will be important for research that relies on a research population with similar characteristics to draw samples for observation or intervention.",2018,2023-04-05 19:18:46,2023-04-05 19:18:46,2023-04-05 19:18:45,,,,5,,,Stages of Biological Development across Age,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\TTW8QE4U\Chao et al. - 2018 - Stages of Biological Development across Age An An.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chi-square tests were performed to check for baseline differences in the dependent and key predictor variables by race. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of discrimination, race, and sense of belonging with pain and functional limitations, net of sociodemographic characteristics, and socioeconomic status.Indigenous respondents showed a clear health disadvantage, with higher rates of pain and functional limitations compared to Whites and Asians.

This is fundamental for the analysis of this biomonitoring database. Methods The CHMS cycle 1 to 4 medication and household data were used to study the trends of medication use between 2007 and 2015. The use of prescription or OTC drugs was grouped based on the first levels of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification system. The total numbers of medications were asked in all cycles. However, only a maximum of 15 and 5 drugs could be respectively reported for existing and new prescription or OTC drugs in cycles 1 and 2. There were no restrictions on drug reporting after cycle 2. The trends of medication use were described as ratios, compared to cycle 1. Results The total numbers of the types of medication ever identified decreased from 739 to 603 between cycles 1 and 4. The proportions of using any drugs were from 0.90 to 0.88 between cycles 1 and 4 (ratio = 1.08 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.26).

Researchers frequently use regression models that only contain a cross-level interaction between Xij and Zj* to test contextual hypotheses in an interaction setting, but this modeling strategy is unable to discriminate the immediate rival hypothesis that attributes a causal role to the corresponding individual-level variable. This paper points out the prevalence of this type of fallacy through a review of past research on contextual determinants of psychiatric resilience.

Importantly, estimates from both data sources find opposite self-selection mechanisms into outmigration. Differences hold despite using the same cohort, survey period, and observable characteristics.

The official primary objectives of the government are protecting public health, restricting access by youth, and reducing illicit drug market activity. The mandate of protecting health and safety shifts the focus from justifying punitive responses to addressing increasing rates of use and related risk behaviours such as driving after cannabis use (DACU). To shed more light on DACU through comparison of data immediately before and after legalization in the Canadian experience, we conducted a multi-wave analysis of the National Cannabis Survey. With particular attention to the influence of gender on perceptions and behaviour of youth and young adults, our findings (reassuringly) suggest there have been no measurable increases in self-reported rates of DACU. Whereas gender is a reliably significant predictor, with DACU being far more common among males, we also found that females in this age group are just as likely to report having been as a passenger of a driver who recently used cannabis.

More importantly, we argue that positive additionalities will be more likely to occur when the subsidies are allocated based on the risk-reward condition of the project. In addition, we show that the risk-sharing effect of government subsidies is influenced by a firm's absorptive capacity and the asset specificity of the project.

Using the Canadian National Population Health Survey between 1998/99 and 2010/11, random effect probit and negative binomial models were employed to model the probability of visit and the total number of visits, respectively. The concentration index-based horizontal inequity (HI) approach was used to measure income-related inequities in physician services. The decomposition technique was applied to explain the factors contributing to the observed inequities. The mobility index (MI) was also calculated to compare short-run and long-run estimates of inequities. The HI indices reveal significant pro-rich inequities in both the probability and the number of specialist visits. Inequities in the likelihood of GP visits and any physician visits were pro-rich but trivial in magnitude. The MI shows that upwardly income mobile individuals contribute to inequity in specialist visits in the long run. After income, education was the most important contributor to inequity in specialist visits, while unobserved heterogeneity explained most of the pro-rich inequity in the total number of GP and any physician visits. Although physician services are free at the point of the provision in Canada, this study demonstrates that poorer older adults utilized fewer specialist services than richer older adults for the same level of need. Specific policies are needed to ensure equity in specialist care use among the older adults in Canada.",2022-08-01,2023-04-05 19:01:29,2023-04-05 19:01:29,,115186,,,307,,Social Science & Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Canada; Equity; Older people; Physician use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The horizontal inequity (HI) index was used to quantify inequity in healthcare utilization for general practitioner (GP) visits, specialist physician (SP) visits and hospital admissions (HA) nationally, in urban and rural areas, and for all provinces. Nationally, GP and SP visits show pro-rich inequity, while HA demonstrates pro-poor inequity. This pattern is consistent in the provincial and urban and rural areas results.

We pooled annual Surveys of Household Spending conducted from 2010 to 2017 (n=34,105) to estimate the catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure (COHE) burden using two definitions: the budget share (OHE exceeding 10% of a household's total consumption) and capacity-to-pay (OHE exceeding 40% of a household's total consumption minus basic subsistence needs). The Wagstaff index (WI) and the Erreygers Index (EI) were used to quantify and decompose socioeconomic inequalities in COHE. Results demonstrate that approximately 6% and 10% of the households faced COHE in Canada, depending on whether we used the budget share or capacity-to-pay approach to measure COHE. The COHE was found to be concentrated among low socioeconomic status (SES) households. Decomposition results indicate that besides SES, household characteristics (e.g., households headed by females and the presence of senior(s) in the households) were the most important factors contributing to the concentration of COHE among the poorer households. The lower utilization of healthcare services among the poor resulted in reduced COHE among these households. A higher burden of COHE is a major concern in Canada.

Starting in 2022, hundreds of thousands of CLB-eligible children will become adults able to make an independent claim for a retroactive benefit payment. While these adults will have formed their own core fiscal unit, eligible for other transfers tied to their own taxfiling, their access to the CLB will be determined by a core fiscal unit that they have left. This arrangement pushes at the boundaries of Canada’s tax and transfer system, which generally assumes coordination within a core fiscal unit, where a fiscal unit refers to family grouping used by the Canada Revenue Agency to asses taxes and transfers. Extant data suggest that taxfiling may be an administrative obstacle for a non-trivial share of children and young adults, but it has not yet received much attention from policymakers. In this article, I discuss options for policy change that might improve access to the CLB by reducing reliance on annual filing to assess income for both adult claimants and current minors eligible for the program.",2022-10-31,2023-04-05 18:54:42,2023-04-05 18:57:15,2023-04-05 18:54:42,,,,,,,Policy Forum,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\WK3F9STU\Robson - 2022 - Policy Forum Does Non-Filing Hinder Access to the.pdf,,,Children; Benefits; Registered Education Savings Plan; Tax Returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This uneven allocation is an important indicator of inequality between women and men. The imbalance is closing, although exactly why remains uncertain. It is also unclear if the convergence has more to do with women's lives becoming more like men's, or whether it is because men are changing their practices on the home front. Using 30 years of nationally representative time use diary data, we explore three broad theoretical frameworks addressing social change—cultural, structural, and demographic—to examine how and why the gender dynamics around housework are shifting. We find that structural factors, and in particular women's engagement with paid work, have changed most sharply as drivers of greater symmetry in domestic labor, although changing cultural beliefs have contributed as well. Furthermore, there have been significant changes in men's behavior. One focal point for this domestic change is in men's and women's shifting practices around childcare.

Weighted multivariate analyses were used for testing associations between diet quality and lifestyle characteristics, and weighted multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models for associations with CVD risk.Construct validity was confirmed for the revised PDI and DGAI 2020 (but not the ERD) because participants in the highest (healthiest) quartile, compared to those in the lowest (least healthy), were more likely to be female (mean ± SE: 52.63% ± 1.27% compared with 44.80% ± 1.65% for revised PDI; 59.37% ± 2.01% compared with 40.84% ± 1.71% for DGAI 2020), older (mean ± SE: 50.55 ± 0.39 y compared with 45.56 ± 0.43 y for revised PDI; 51.57 ± 0.39 y compared with 46.35 ± 0.54 y for DGAI 2020), to have postsecondary education (mean ± SE: 32.36% ± 1.55% compared with 21.12% ± 1.31% for revised PDI; 34.17% ± 2.69% compared with 17.87% ± 0.98% for DGAI 2020), and less likely to be daily smokers (mean ± SE: 8.21% ± 1.0% compared with 17.06% ± 1.45% for revised PDI; 7.36% ± 1.71% compared with 21.53% ± 1.58% for DGAI 2020) (P-trend &lt; 0.0001). No significant associations were observed between dietary index scores and CVD risk.The revised PDI and DGAI 2020 provided valid and meaningful measures of plant-based eating among Canadians, whereas the validity of the ERD was not directly confirmed.

Such an investigation is important because migration can help reduce labour shortages and surpluses and allow journeypersons to obtain gainful employment. In this paper we investigate the E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons. Drawing on data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) from 2008 to 2016, we find that while Ontario and Alberta gain the most migrants, the Atlantic region has more than 30% of its workforce that engages in E-RGM. Of the most mobile trades are steamfitters and pipefitters, ironworkers, and construction trade helpers and labourers. Moreover, those who are married, immigrants, and women are less likely to engage in E-RGM than are single journeypersons, non-immigrants, and men. Red Seal trades or endorsements were associated with greater mobility; however, whether journeypersons were registered in their province of residence was the greatest predictor of mobility. This finding suggests that while Red Seal programs have succeeded in creating standardised expectations across provinces and territories, place of residence has important implications for E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons. These findings point to the need for more research that examines the root causes of migration.",2023-03-01,2023-04-05 15:10:39,2023-04-05 15:10:39,2023-04-03 15:53:55,91-118,,1,16,,Appl.

A trend analysis of nationally representative microdata shows that household formation is the missing link in the paradox and that many young adults aged 18–44 have failed to form independent households from 2011 to 2017, thereby delaying the start of their housing pathways. When factors such as socioeconomic and institutional attributes are controlled for, age differences in household formation decrease as expected. However, the age differences grow surprisingly larger over the study period, reflective of reform-induced changes in resource allocation. Further analysis demonstrates significant heterogeneity in headship status. While local young adults are squeezing into homeownership, migrants are overrepresented in the relatively stunted rental sector. Thus, while migration has brought newcomers to urban China and kept the headship rates from falling even further, institutional barriers have blocked migrants’ housing pathways. Overall, the pace of change is breathtaking.

We assess the contributions of food insecurity and home ownership to income-related equity in dental care use and access. We add to the literature by adding these two variables among other socio-economic determinants of equity in dental care use and access to dental care. Evidence on equity in access to and use of dental care in Canada can inform policymaking. METHODS: We estimate income-related horizontal inequity indexes for the probability of 1) receiving at least one dental visit in the last 12 months; and 2) lack of dental visits during the 3 years before the interview. We conduct the analyses using data from the 2013-2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) at the national and regional level. RESULTS: There is pro-rich inequity in the probability of visiting a dentist or an orthodontist and in access to dental care in Ontario. Inequities vary across jurisdictions. Housing tenure and food insecurity contribute importantly to both use of and access to dental care, adding information not captured by standard socio-economic determinants.

While smoking is the most important risk factor, environmental and occupational carcinogens have been found to significantly contribute to BC rates. As Canada is highly reliant on natural resource industries, this study seeks to identify geographical and industry-related trends of BC rates in Ontario. Methods: The 1991 and 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC; Statistics Canada) was used, along with individual years of census data. Maps identifying hot and cold spots for BC within Ontario were generated, and the former were assessed for industry patterns between location and BC rates. Cox proportional hazards models were run for each age cohort to predict the likelihood of developing BC by industry of work. Results: Significant geographical and industrial trends in BC rates were identified. For 1991–2001, hot spots included the Cochrane, Manitoulin, Parry Sound, and Sudbury (90% confidence interval [CI]), and Nipissing and Temiskaming (95% CI) regions. Toronto and York were cold spots. Concurrently, metal (p=0.039), paper and publishing (p=0.0062), and wood and furniture (p&lt;0.0001) industries had increased rates of BC. Notably, these industries had high employment density in our hot spot areas and low density in our cold spots.

Given the broad salutary effects of R/S, we tested if nonreligious groups (specifically atheists) were more likely to report impairment or were more likely to report greater disability. Using Canadian data (N ≥ 1,000) from the 2015 General Social Survey (Cycle 29), we compared atheists to Agnostics, Nones, Protestants, Catholics, Christian Orthodox, and Eastern Religion practitioners. The results indicated that Atheists were slightly more likely to report the presence of impairment and disability relative to Catholics, but these effects were in the trivial-to-small range. When exploring the severity of self-reported disability across religious groups, atheists did not differ from any other religious group. These results are intriguing as the broader R/S-health literature has suggested that greater secularism should be associated with a health penalty; however, we found limited evidence to support this. Although we cannot state that atheism is necessarily healthy, the results of the current study would suggest that atheism is certainly not unhealthy.",2022-10-12,2023-04-24 20:30:23,2023-04-24 20:30:46,2023-04-24 20:30:23,1-20,,,,,,Created Sick?,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/23312521.2022.2130500,,"C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\NH2QXCHD\Speed et al. - 2022 - Created Sick Well, Not Exactly… Canadian Atheists.pdf",,,Disability; impairment; psychology; religion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We searched multiple databases for studies that evaluated school-based interventions to prevent obesity and associated risk factors (i.e., unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour) in children aged 4–18 years from January 1, 2012 to January 28, 2020. From 10,871 identified records, we included 83 and 80 studies in our systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively.

Specifically, we compare consumer spending on various product categories before the pandemic started to after. Unlike previous work, we not only look at the different consumer demographic profiles but also different product categories, providing a better understanding of spending behavior. E-commerce has been a favorite way of shopping for consumers before the pandemic, while some demographic groups were reluctant to use e-commerce. However, as pandemic-related restrictions on physical shopping were put in place, consumers found e-commerce the only way to shop for many essential products. As such, consumer online spending changed. We employ freshly released Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) data on consumer spending by Statistics Canada. We examine the association between various demographic factors and the change in online spending empirically. Our findings indicate that, compared to their counterparts, younger consumers are more likely to have increased online spending on product categories related to internet connectivity and streaming services. Female consumers exhibit increased online spending on similar products, in addition to online learning services and home exercise equipment. Consumers living in urban areas exhibit a higher probability of increased online spending on computers, smartphone devices, internet connectivity, and food delivery services.

However, the contribution of married immigrant women to the Canadian labour market was—until recently—considered of secondary importance and their labour market choices studied within an economic framework of temporary attachment to the labour force. Recent research, however, finds that a significant fraction of married immigrant women make labour supply decisions (and face barriers) similar to those of native-born married women. We show that this is the case in Canada as well, by estimating the progress of immigrant women over the 2000s. We use traditional measures of labour market outcomes, such as participation, employment and wages, but also novel estimates of labour market dynamics, such as transitions across labour market states to show the work trajectories of married Canadian immigrant women. Results show that immigrant women are less likely to transition into employment—more likely to transition out of employment to either unemployment or inactivity—and more likely to respond to income shocks than the Canadian born. There is evidence of a gradual convergence with years spent in Canada to the outcomes of the Canadian born, which is much slower for immigrant women than immigrant men.",2023-02-25,2023-04-24 20:18:41,2023-04-24 20:18:41,2023-04-24 20:18:41,,,,,,Int.

We quantified the farm-to-fork GWP of six DPs (Omnivorous, No Pork, No Beef, No Red Meat, Pescatarian, and Vegetarian), using dietary intake data from a 2014 and 2015 survey. Throughout this period, the biggest decrease in GWP was for DPs containing beef, even though these DPs still have the highest GWP (3203 and 2308 kg CO2e, respectively, based on the annual energy intake of one individual). Across all DPs, plant-based proteins contributed less than 5% to GWP, while meat and fish contributed up to 62% of the total GWP. Ten-year GWP reductions are insufficient to meet climate change and other sustainability goals, and major dietary shifts are needed, particularly substituting animal-based proteins with plant-based proteins.

Only a few studies have examined this association, and most of those have analyzed this issue on a provincial level. This study examined the association between opioid-related health outcomes and SES, and investigated rate ratios over time. METHODS: Administrative databases were used to identify opioid-related mortality, hospitalization and emergency department visits between 2000 and 2017. Patient's postal code was linked to the quintile of median household income at the forward sortation area level. Crude rates and age- and sex-adjusted rates in each quintile were calculated, as well as the adjusted rate ratio of average annual rates between the lowest and highest quintiles. The significance of the time trend of rate ratios for all outcomes was examined using linear regression. RESULTS: A stepped gradient of opioid-related outcomes across all income quintiles emerged from these data. For mortality, hospitalization and emergency department visits, the average annual rate ratio between lowest quintile and highest quintile was 3.8, 4.3 and 4.9, respectively. These ratios were generally stable and consistent over the study period, albeit the opioid-related mortality SES gap decreased gradually (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Area income quintile was found to be highly associated with opioid outcomes. Psychosocial factors (stress, unemployment, housing insecurity) that are typically concentrated in low SES areas may play a significant role in the opioid epidemic.

The study integrates JBA Risk Management's 100-year Canada Flood Map with the 2016 national census-based socioeconomic data to investigate whether traditionally recognized vulnerable groups and communities are exposed inequitably to inland (e.g., fluvial and pluvial) and coastal flood hazards. Social vulnerability was represented by neighbourhood-level socioeconomic deprivation, including economic insecurity and instability indices. Statistical analyses include bivariate correlation and a series of non-spatial and spatial regression techniques, including ordinary least squares, binary logistic regression, and simultaneous autoregressive models. The study emphasizes the quest for the most appropriate methodological framework to analyze flood-related socioeconomic inequities in Canada. Strong evidence of spatial effects has motivated the study to test for the spatial heterogeneity of covariates by employing geographically weighted regression (GWR) on continuous outcome variables (e.g., percent of residential properties in a census tract exposed to flood hazards) and geographically weighted logistic regression on dichotomous outcome variables (e.g., a census tract in or out of flood hazard zone). GWR results show that the direction and statistical significance of relationships between inland flood exposure and all explanatory variables under consideration are spatially non-stationary. We find certain vulnerable groups, such as females, lone-parent households, Indigenous peoples, South Asians, the elderly, other visible minorities, and economically insecure residents, are at a higher risk of flooding in Canadian neighbourhoods. Spatial and social disparities in flood exposure have critical policy implications for effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction.

Residential flood exposure data were spatially integrated with a census-based multidimensional social vulnerability index (SoVI) that included demographic, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic indicators influencing vulnerability. Using Bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (BiLISA) cluster maps, the study identified geographic concentration of flood risk hotspots where high vulnerability coincided with high flood exposure. The results revealed considerable spatial variations in tract-level social vulnerability and flood exposure.

However, heterogeneity in our sample revealed that attending formal childcare increased the probability of enrollment in higher education for children from low-income and non-employed families. This study suggests that attending informal childcare in Canada in 1994–1995 benefited all children over 20 years later, whereas attending formal childcare appears to be protective for children from more disadvantaged families.",2022-08-01,2023-04-12 14:02:07,2023-04-12 14:02:07,,101615,,,80,,Learning and Instruction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Childcare; Early childhood education; Higher education; Longitudinal study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some causes of death are more preventable than others, and access to prevention is theorized to follow patterns of access to social and material resources. The objective of this study is to compare estimates of preventable mortality between sexual minority (SM)—i.e., bisexual, lesbian, gay—and heterosexual adults in Canada. Methods A population-based retrospective cohort with 442,260 (unweighted N) Canadian adults, ages 18–59 years, was drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey/Canadian Mortality Database linked database (2003–2017). The Rutstein preventability rating index was used to classify cause-specific mortality (low/high). Longitudinal analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards models. Results SM respondents had higher hazard of all-cause mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio [uHR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.06, 1.55). The uHR increased when the outcome was limited to highly-preventable causes of mortality (uHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14, 1.80). The uHR further increased in sensitivity analyses using higher thresholds of the Rutstein index. SM respondents had higher hazard of cause-specific mortality for heart disease (uHR 1.53, 95% CI 1.03, 2.29), accidents (uHR 1.97, 95% CI 1.01, 3.86), HIV (uHR 75.69, 95% CI 18.77, 305.20), and suicide (uHR 2.22, 95% CI 0.93, 5.30) but not for cancer (uHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.60, 1.25). The adjusted HR (aHR) for highly-preventable mortality was not attenuated by adjustment for confounders (aHR 1.57, 95% CI 1.20, 2.05) but was reduced by adjustment for hypothesized mediators relating to access to social and material resources (marital status, children, income, education; aHR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78, 1.58). Conclusions Preventable mortality was elevated for SM Canadians compared to heterosexuals.

This study also examined the extent to which socio-demographic variables predicted formal help seeking among male victims of IPV. Data were drawn from 2009 and 2014 cycles of the Canadian General Social Survey on Victimization with a nationally representative sample of 52,400 respondents. It is estimated that about 655,400 men in Canada reported having experienced physical and/or sexual victimization due to IPV in married/common-law relationships at the time of the surveys between 2004 and 2014. The latent class analysis generated four types of IPV victimization among men. Among male victims of physical and/or sexual IPV, about 64,000 men experienced the most severe type of IPV characterized by chronic and severe physical and psychological violence with a high probability of injuries and negative emotional effects of IPV. Although most of the male victims of IPV did not seek formal help (e.g., did not contact the police and IPV services), the severity of experienced violence was associated with the increased use of formal services. Some structural factors, such as being unemployed and residing with young children, were found to be substantial barriers to contacting formal agencies for help.

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension in Canadian adults and examine the characteristics of those affected. Methods A nationally representative cross-sectional study was conducted with the use of Canadian Health Measures Survey (2007-2017) data. The frequency of respondents with uncontrolled blood pressure despite 3 or more antihypertensive medications of different drug classes (and at least 1 agent being a diuretic), or treatment with 4 or more agents regardless of blood pressure, was determined. Results A total of 245,700 people were identified to have apparent treatment-resistant hypertension, representing 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5%–6.2%) of adults treated for hypertension in Canada. Respondents who had uncontrolled blood pressure with 3 or more antihypertensive drugs were more likely women (55.8%, 95% CI 41.1%-70.4%), 70 years of age or older (45.3% 95% CI 32.8%-57.9%), and overweight or obese (84.2%, 95% CI 72.3%-96.1%). Respondents with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension also had a high likelihood of chronic kidney disease (36.0%, 95% CI 21.4%-50.6%), diabetes (35.2%, 95% CI 21.7%-48.7%), dyslipidemia (68.0%, 95% CI 55.2%-80.8%), and history of heart attack (9.9%, 95% CI 4.8%-15.1%) or stroke (7.1%, 95% CI 0-14.4%). Conclusions Despite being prescribed at least 3 antihypertensive drugs, a considerable proportion of Canadians, especially women, have difficulty achieving blood pressure control, predisposing them to a higher risk of cardiovascular complications and death.

We aimed to assess risk of suicidality among transgender and sexual minority adolescents in Canada. Methods: We analyzed a subsample of adolescents aged 15–17 years from the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. We defined participants’ transgender identity (self-reported gender different from sex assigned at birth) and sexual minority status (self-reported attraction to people of the same gender) as exposures, and their self-reported previous-year suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempt as outcomes. Results: We included 6800 adolescents aged 15–17 years, including 1130 (16.5%) who indicated some degree of same-gender attraction, 265 (4.3%) who were unsure of their attraction and 50 (0.6%) who reported a transgender identity. Compared with cisgender, heterosexual adolescents, transgender adolescents showed 5 times the risk of suicidal ideation (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.63 to 6.75; 58% v. 10%) and 7.6 times the risk of suicide attempt (95% CI 4.76 to 12.10; 40% v. 5%).

Adolescents attracted to multiple genders had 2.5 times the risk of suicidal ideation (95% CI 2.12 to 2.98) and 2.8 times the risk of suicide attempt (95% CI 2.18 to 3.68). Youth questioning their sexual orientation had twice the risk of having attempted suicide in their lifetime (95% CI 1.23 to 3.36).

Individuals with higher levels of human capital, typically measured through education, earn more on average and are privy to greater levels of upward change over time. Nevertheless, other factors may have an incremental effect over education, namely cognitive ability and the skill demands of employment. To deepen insight into whether these aspects contribute to earnings mobility over a four-year period, the present study examines positional change in Canada and Germany—two contexts typified as examples of liberal and coordinated market economies. A series of descriptive indices and relative change models assess how different measures of human capital are associated with earnings mobility. The results indicate that, while individuals with higher cognitive skills experience greater earnings stability and upward mobility in both countries, there is only an incremental effect of skills on mobility in Germany once we account for educational credentials. The results also provide evidence on the role of skill demands for earnings mobility; in both countries, advanced skills at work are associated with greater short-term mobility, even while controlling for cognitive ability and other factors.

Extreme temperature can affect manufacturing activity directly through its impact on labour productivity and indirectly through a change in demand for products.

Each day where outdoor mean temperatures are below −18\ -18 \ °C or above 24 °C reduces annual manufacturing output by 0.18% and 0.11%, respectively, relative to a day with mean temperature between 12 ° and 18 °C.

Design/methodology/approach Across 3,230 gender harassment, 890 sexual advance harassment and 570 sexual assault incidents that occurred within a traditionally masculine organization, the authors conducted tests of independence and hierarchical regression analyses to examine whether targets' social identity characteristics (i.e. sex, race, sexuality and gender alignment), predicted the reporting of sexual misconduct. Findings Although reporting rates varied based on the type of incident, white men were less likely than their colleagues to report workplace sexual misconduct. In general, men were approximately half as likely as women to report. Lower rates of reporting were similarly seen among all white (vs BIPOC) targets and all cisgender and heterosexual (vs LGBT) targets, when controlling for other identity characteristics. Originality/value Research on sexual misconduct has largely privileged the experiences of (white, heterosexual) women, despite knowledge that men, too, can experience this mistreatment. This research broadens this lens and challenges the notion that sexual misconduct reporting rates are uniform across employee groups. By articulating how the pressures of hegemonic masculinity serve to silence certain targets – including and especially white, cisgender men – the authors provide means of better understanding and addressing workplace sexual misconduct underreporting.",2022-01-01,2023-04-11 19:56:26,2023-04-11 19:56:26,2023-04-11 19:56:26,398-415,,3,42,,,Sexual misconduct reporting,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\XZWM5XAI\Smith et al. - 2022 - Sexual misconduct reporting the silencing effects.pdf,,,Employee voice; Hegemonic masculinity; Organizational culture; Sexual misconduct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on data from the 2014 General Social Survey (Statistics Canada), my analysis suggests that there are important variations in levels of satisfaction with the police linked to where individuals live. Those in rural communities are more likely to be satisfied with police performance and with their relations with police than those in urban regions, although the level of satisfaction declines as communities become increasingly geographically isolated.

Accordingly, this article proposes to examine variations in self-reported encounters with the police for behavioral health-related reasons across urban, rural, and remote communities. Using data from the 2014 General Social Survey, a representative sample of the Canadian population, we assess these self-reported encounters from two different angles: encounters for one's own behavioral health crisis and encounters for a family member's behavioral health needs. While findings on the former are inconclusive, those examining police contacts for a family member suggest that living in rural or remote communities is significantly associated with a greater probability of experiencing such situations relative to living in urban areas. Furthermore, this probability increases with the relative geographical isolation of communities.

Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether ACEs are prospectively associated with incident health-professional diagnosed migraine and prevalence of non-migraine frequent headache in adolescence, either directly or indirectly through symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods We used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a Canadian cohort study that followed children aged 0/1 at baseline, and the person most knowledgeable about them (PMK) until the child reached adolescence. The PMK reported on 14 ACEs (e.g., parental death) when the child was 4/5 and 6/7 years, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in late childhood (age 8/9 years), using a validated tool. Migraine (primary outcome) was ascertained via PMK report of a health-professional diagnosis, and non-migraine frequent headache (>1 time per week) was adolescent self-report, both measured at age 14/15. We estimated direct and indirect effects (IEs) on the log-odds scale through symptoms of depression and anxiety (mediator). We adjusted for sex, parental migraine, and economic deprivation. The analytic sample sizes were: n = 2058 (migraine) and n = 1730 (frequent headache). Results There were nunweighted = 71 respondents with migraine (3.4%, 71/2058) and nunweighted = 204 with non-migraine frequent headache (11.8%, 204/1730). Most respondents experienced no ACEs (weighted percentage = 55.7), followed by 1 ACE (weighted percentage = 34.7) and greater than or equal to two ACEs (weighted percentage = 9.6), respectively.

There were no indirect relationships through symptoms of depression and anxiety for migraine (1 ACE: OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.99–1.13 and ≥2 ACEs: OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98–1.28) or non-migraine frequent headache (1 ACE: OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.95–1.03 and ≥2 ACEs: OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.90–1.07).

However, since traditional tax statistics include capital gains in the total income of individuals, some individuals see their annual income artificially inflated by the one-time realization of a capital gain. The authors use Statistics Canada's Longitudinal Administrative Databank to better identify who really benefits from the preferential treatment of capital gains in Canada and to determine their frequency of realization. Specifically, the authors measure the shift of taxpayers between five income groups depending on whether or not their capital gains are considered in their total income. While wealthier taxpayers do benefit disproportionately from the preferential treatment of capital gains, the exclusion of capital gains from total income significantly reduces this disproportion. Taxpayers with more modest incomes benefit more than one would expect from the preferential treatment of capital gains, especially when they are over 55 years old. Taxpayers with higher incomes also realize capital gains more frequently than those with lower incomes. That said, among taxable capital gain filers only, this gap is much smaller, indicating that once taxpayers report capital gains, they tend to do so frequently.

Methods We used Interrupted Time Series design and data from nationally-representative repeated cross-sectional Canadian surveys spanning 16 years. The primary outcomes were cannabis initiation rates and cannabis use prevalence among youths. The secondary outcomes were self-reported age of first cannabis use, ease of cannabis access, and perception of cannabis harm among youths. Results After legalization, cannabis initiation rate among youths was 2.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 1.7–3.7; p < .01) or 69% higher, although there was no significant increase in the overall prevalence of cannabis use.

This study aimed to measure the effects of e-cigarette use on youth mental health, using e-cigarette minimum legal age (MLA) law in Canada as a natural experiment. Design We used difference-in-differences (DD), difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) and two-sample instrumental variables (TSIV) methods. Setting Data were from nationally representative Canadian Community Health Surveys 2008–2019 and Canadian Student Tobacco Alcohol and Drugs Surveys 2008–2019. Participants The study sample comprised of respondents aged 15 to 18 (in DD analysis; n = 33 858) and aged 15 to 24 (in DDD analysis; n = 78 689). Measurements Primary outcomes were self-reported mood disorders and anxiety disorders. Secondary outcomes were cannabis use, illicit drug use, cigarette use and strength of peer relationships at schools. Findings After the e-cigarette MLA laws, risks of mood disorders declined by 1.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.0–3.8; P = 0.05) in the DD analysis and by 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2–5.0; P = 0.03) in the DDD analysis. For anxiety disorders, while the DD estimate was negative but imprecisely estimated, the MLA law reduced risks of anxiety disorder by 3.6 percentage points (95% CI, 0.9–6.2; P = 0.01) in the DDD analysis. Youths in provinces with MLA laws were also less likely to report cannabis use and illicit drug use and more likely to feel being part of schools. TSIV analysis indicates that youth e-cigarette use increased the likelihood of mood and anxiety disorders by 44% and 37%, respectively. Conclusion and Relevance In Canada, the e-cigarette minimum legal age law appears to have reduced risks of mood and anxiety disorders, lowered substance use and improved peer relationships at schools. Combined with previous evidence of lower e-cigarette use following the minimum legal age law, our findings indicate that youth e-cigarette use increases risks of mood and anxiety disorders.",2022,2023-04-11 19:42:34,2023-04-11 19:42:34,2023-04-11 19:42:34,2673-2682,,10,117,,,Effects of e-cigarette use on mental health among youths,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/add.15943,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\8C7ALY77\Nguyen and Mital - 2022 - Effects of e-cigarette use on mental health among .pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\NH7RKMT2\add.html,,,Anxiety disorders; difference-in-differences; e-cigarettes; minimum legal age; mood disorders; two-sample instrumental variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WZAHP22E,journalArticle,2022,"Nguyen, Hai V.; Mital, Shweta","Changes in Youth Cannabis Use After an Increase in Cannabis Minimum Legal Age in Quebec, Canada",JAMA network open,,2574-3805,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.17648,,"IMPORTANCE: In January 2020, Quebec raised the minimum legal age (MLA) for cannabis from 18 to 21 years. Evidence is needed to inform the ongoing debate on this policy. Although proponents believe that a higher MLA will protect youths from the harms of cannabis use, critics argue that it will push them back to the illegal market. OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in youth cannabis use after an increase in MLA for cannabis in Quebec. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study with difference-in-differences analysis compared changes in cannabis use among youths aged 15 to 20 years in Quebec vs all other Canadian provinces before and after Quebec's increase in MLA. All estimates in descriptive and regression analyses were weighted. Nationally representative data from the National Cannabis Surveys 2018-2020 were used. INTERVENTION: Increase in MLA for cannabis in Quebec implemented in January 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Past-3-month cannabis use. RESULTS: The study sample included 1005 respondents (mean [SD] age, 17.5 [1.7] years; 50.2% [SD, 50.0%] male). After policy implementation, the increase in past-3-month cannabis use among youths aged 18 to 20 was 16.4 percentage points (95% CI, -27.3 to -5.5 percentage points; P = .01), or 51%, lower in Quebec than in other provinces. Meanwhile, no significant change in cannabis use among youths aged 15 to 17 years was found. The results were robust to several checks, including accounting for possible confounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, an increase in the MLA from 18 to 21 years in Quebec was associated with a significantly lower increase in cannabis use among youths aged 18 to 20 years but no change in cannabis use among those aged 15 to 17 years. These findings can help to alleviate concerns that youths would switch to illegal markets in response to a higher MLA.",2022-06-01,2023-04-11 19:41:44,2023-04-11 19:41:44,,e2217648,,6,5,,JAMA Netw Open,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 35713901 PMCID: PMC9206191,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\4SR2YBV5\Nguyen and Mital - 2022 - Changes in Youth Cannabis Use After an Increase in.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35713901,,Canada; Humans; COVID-19; Adolescent; Female; Male; Cannabis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; Quebec,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article innovates by simultaneously taking into account how hostile behaviours, poor working conditions and employment precariousness are associated with different subjective measures of well-being. This study uses a person-centered approach by conducting latent class analysis on a representative sample of 5,867 Canadian employees. Six distinct clusters are revealed: “heavily suffering”, “unfulfilled precarious”, “unhealthy stressed”, “untroubled harassed”, “optimistic precarious” and “not exposed”. This article thus shows that it is not harassment or lack of social benefits per se that affect workers’ well-being. It demonstrates that workers’ well-being deteriorates only when hostile behaviours/conflicts and poor working/employment conditions overlap. Binary logistic regression analyses reveal that, controlling for other worker characteristics, this typology of workers is related to work ethic and resilience.

However, these plans do not typically lock in funds, which means savers may also withdraw before retirement when their marginal tax rates are still high and forgo the tax benefit. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which pre-retirement savings withdrawals respond to changes in the net-of-tax benefit of withdrawing and whether such behavior depends on the saver’s financial literacy. To that end, we link respondents of a nationally representative financial capability survey from Canada to over 15 years of administrative tax data. Our results show that the correlation between savings withdrawals and the effective marginal tax rate is negative for those with higher financial literacy, but much weaker and sometimes statistically insignificant for those with lower financial literacy.

Few studies have examined the association between comorbid externalising and internalising symptoms and adult-life economic participation.ObjectivesTo investigate associations of childhood externalising, internalising, and comorbid internalising-externalising symptoms with earnings and welfare receipt in adulthood.MethodsWe used group-based trajectory modeling to identify profiles of children with externalising, internalising, and comorbid symptoms from age 6-12 years. We estimated associations of the identified profiles with participants’ employment earnings at age 33-37 years and welfare receipt from age 18-35 years obtained from tax return records. The child’s IQ and family socioeconomic background were adjusted for.ResultsFour profiles were identified: no symptoms (45%), externalizing (29%), internalizing (11%) and comorbid symptoms (13%). Relative to the no-symptom profile, participants in the comorbid profile earned US$-18,323 less annually (95%CI=-20,925 to -15700) at age 33-37 years and were significantly more likely to receive welfare across follow-up (RR=6.30, 95%CI=5.4 to 7.2). Similarly, compared to the no-symptom profile, participants in the externalising profile earned US$-7,256 less per year (95%CI=-9,205 to -5,307), while participants in the internalising profile earned US$-9,716 less (95%CI=-12,358 to -7,074). Significant interactions by sex were observed. For participants in the comorbid profile, males were more likely to have lower earnings while females were more likely to receive welfare, relative to the no-symptom profile.ConclusionsChildren exhibiting comorbid externalising and internalising symptoms are at high risk of poor economic outcomes in adulthood.

Data come from a cross-sectional epidemiological sample (N = 10,605 children ages 4-17, 6434 households). Parents rated child internalizing and externalizing symptoms and their parenting toward each child. General and specific (internalizing, externalizing) psychopathology factors, derived with bifactor modeling, were regressed on parenting using multilevel modeling. Less warmth and more aversive/inconsistent parenting in the family, and toward an individual child relative to family average, were associated with higher general psychopathology and specific externalizing problems.

With this move, Canada has made it clear that immigrants are expected to play a lead role in the post-pandemic economic recovery. Most of these immigrants will be admitted through Express Entry, a hybrid system introduced in 2015 that combines elements of both supply- and demand-driven selection. In this article, we examine whether Canada’s hybrid selection system meets its current and future labor market needs in a post-pandemic world. Using a mixed methods approach, we combine analysis of an administrative dataset with data from qualitative interviews with employers and experts in the immigration sector. We find that while Express Entry is a flexible and responsive tool for selecting immigrants, it narrows the occupational profiles of newcomers. The system also does not fully address the labor shortages and skills gaps described by Canadian employers. We argue that Canada’s post-pandemic labor market will require a wider range of skills, and that Express Entry’s adaptability should be carefully monitored and adjusted to broaden the skill mix of immigrants and facilitate skills match between immigrants and employers.",2023-01-02,2023-04-11 17:16:02,2023-04-11 17:16:02,2023-04-11 17:16:02,104-118,,1,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15562948.2022.2133201,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\25HKFE5H\Zhang et al. - 2023 - Does Canada’s Express Entry System Meet the Challe.pdf,,,Express Entry; immigration policy; mixed methods; occupation; post-covid economy; skill gap; Skilled immigrants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the gendered distributions seem to approach numerical parity, the more nuanced the analyses, the less equitable these distributions appear. When juxtaposed with Statistics Canada data on English doctoral recipients, such patterns betray unsettling structural inequities for women scholars. Women have earned over 60% of the English PhDs in Canada in the previous two decades, but these numbers have not materialized in the professoriat. Instead, a man with an English PhD has enjoyed a 50% greater chance than a similarly credentialed woman of garnering a tenure-track position, in departments both with and without doctoral programs. Women are more likely than men to teach in departments without PhD programs, to teach outside the tenure stream, and to be pushed out of academe altogether. Along with a constellation of frequently discussed impediments, one ubiquitous but unexamined logic understood to benefit women English PhD holders actually disadvantages them in competitions for tenure-track positions: the commonplace belief that numerical gender balance among tenure-track and tenured faculty in an English department constitutes parity. In practice, producing such gender balance not only fails to achieve equity in hiring but helps to facilitate the overhiring of men.",2022-01-01,2023-04-11 17:12:10,2023-04-11 17:12:10,,102531,,,90,,Women's Studies International Forum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Academe; Adjuncts; Gender discrimination; Professoriat; Professors; Universities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may explain the lack of serious consideration or remedial action by medical associations and governments in negotiations, or tariff and compensation processes. Our study employs 2016 Canadian Census data linked to Canada Revenue Agency taxation records. Rather than focusing on gross billings, we model physician net earnings (after overhead expenses and controlling for hours/weeks of work) including dividends from corporations. Using OLS, and unconditional quantile regression to document the gap across the earnings distribution, we observe that Canadian female physicians, on average, earn 9.3% less than their male counterparts. The average adjusted gap is slightly smaller for family physicians (8.5%) than other specialists (10.2%). Beyond averages, at the top of the income distribution the gap is double that at the median for both family physicians and other specialists. The gap also varies across provinces, from 6.6% in Quebec to 19.8% in Manitoba.

Indeed, research with Indigenous populations in Canada has captured that prior experiences of residential schools contributes to the intergenerational transmission of mental and physical health disparities. Despite these studies, further research is needed that contextualizes the influence of residential schools within broader frameworks that consider Indigenous social determinants of health in Canada. As such, the purpose of the present study was to examine patterns of substance use and mental and physical health among individuals with a history of residential school attendance (RSA) and individuals reporting parent or two-generation (parent and grandparent) RSA. Method Data from the Aboriginal Peoples Survey (2017), involving 10,030 First Nations individuals living off reserve, were analyzed. Results Self-reported mental and physical health scores were significantly lower among those had attended residential schools, whose parents attended residential schools, and whose grandparents attended residential schools, when compared to those who did not. Further, family RSA was associated with increased substance use among participants, though the findings were variable based on sex and specific substance analyzed. Meanwhile, individual and family RSA was not associated with increased likelihood of a mental health diagnosis. Discussion These findings provide additional support for how both parental and two-generation family histories of RSA are associated with individual physical and mental health outcomes. Further, these findings articulate the need for the TRCC's Calls to Action to be actually implemented, including community-based approaches that harness the strength of Indigenous people and communities who aim to close the gap in these health disparities for their children and families.",2023-01-20,2023-04-11 17:07:23,2023-04-11 17:07:23,2023-04-11 17:07:23,1029139,,,10,,Front Public Health,Intergenerational residential school attendance and increased substance use among First Nation adults living off-reserve,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 36743177 PMCID: PMC9895934,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\APMYCQUW\Toombs et al. - 2023 - Intergenerational residential school attendance an.pdf; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9895934/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to understand (a) whether housing assets and income are associated with mortality and (b) if the value of housing assets affects the relationship between income and mortality; both questions are studied among older adults aged 65 or over in Canada. Methods Using the population-based linked dataset (2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts) of 881,220 older adults over six years of follow-up (2011–2017), this study uses survival analysis to estimate the link between housing assets, income level and mortality. We also assess the potential moderating effect of housing asset levels on the association between income and mortality by categorizing individuals along two dimensions: whether they are income-poor and whether they are housing assets-poor. Results The mortality rate was higher among both the lowest asset (HR = 1.346) and the lowest income group (HR = 1.203). The association is pronounced for older adults aged 65 to 74. Assets did not significantly moderate the link between income and mortality. Income-related inequalities in mortality are observed among each group of housing asset level. Compared to those who are neither income-poor nor housing assets-poor, individuals who were income poor but not housing assets-poor were more likely to die (HR = 1.067) over seven years of follow-up, and people who were housing assets-poor only were more likely to die (HR = 1.210). Being housing-assets poor and income-poor yielded a higher hazard ratio (HR = 1.291). Conclusions Housing assets and income are associated with mortality of older adults. It is important to identify people who are assets poor and/or income poor who are at higher risks of mortality. Social policies aimed at reducing income insecurity and housing insecurity can reduce mortality inequalities.",2022-12-01,2023-04-11 17:02:45,2023-04-11 17:02:45,,115429,,,314,,Social Science & Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Canada; Socioeconomic inequality; Mortality; Housing asset poverty; Income poverty; Older adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6Q5WS869,report,2022,"St-Denis, Xavier; Renée, Laëtitia",The Relative Role of Parental Income and Parental Education in Child Educational Achievement and Socioeconomic Status Attainment: A Decomposition Approach,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/1807/123980,"In this paper, we provide evidence on the relative importance of two family background variables for the educational attainment and income level achieved by Canadians: parental education and parental income. We find that parental education is more strongly related to a child’s educational attainment than parental income, although parental income also plays a significant role both statistically and substantively. These findings call into question less nuanced interpretations of some existing studies, which often appear to discount the role of parental income and financial obstacles to postsecondary education participation. At the same time, this study is consistent with existing evidence of the independent role of parental education in child educational attainment, hinting at important non-financial obstacles to educational attainment.

A young adult from a family in the bottom income quintile is 30% less likely to attend a post-secondary institution than someone from a family in the top income quintile.     In response to these concerns, several policies and interventions have been developed to encourage the enrolment of low-income students. Surprisingly, despite large amounts of money spent on these policies and interventions, little is known on their relative effectiveness in improving students’ success    This report analyses the effects of various interventions, such as counselling and financial aid, on students’ short- and long-run outcomes. In spite of past studies suggesting that such interventions were less than successful, our analysis of SRDC’s Future To Discover project shows that at least one of these interventions—counselling—had a powerful effect on increasing both high- and low-income students’ monetary outcomes.    But the effectiveness of this winning intervention is not wholly positive. It also increased university dropout rates, suggesting that some students who were induced to enrol through the intervention failed to graduate.

This medication class has been previously associated with adverse effects. To date, far too little attention has been paid to physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors (SB) in adults using antidepressant medication. The study aims to compare objectively measured time in PA and SB behaviors in a population-based sample of adults using antidepressant medication compared to a group of adults not using any psychotropic medication, and to investigate whether these behaviors differ according to four antidepressant classes. Methods We used representative data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2007–2013). Medication use was documented during an in-house visit. PA and SB were measured by accelerometer. We included 7680 participants aged 18–79 years. A set of weighted analyses of covariance with adjustments for sex, age, body-mass index, income, education level, season, smoking and marital status was conducted to compare mean differences in PA and SB variables between adults using antidepressants and controls. Results The cross-sectional weighted prevalence of antidepressant use was 9.3%. Adults using antidepressants completed significantly fewer minutes of moderate to vigorous PA and steps daily compared to adults without psychotropic medication. Daily time spent in light PA and SB were not significantly different between both groups. Sensitivity analyses controlling for self-reported mental and physical health showed no significant difference except smaller time spent in moderate to vigorous PA in adults using SSRI antidepressants than control. Conclusion Due to the potential negative side effects associated with antidepressant usage, and the present findings demonstrating lower levels of MVPA in those taking SSRIs, care providers should consider assessing levels of MVPA and if relevant promoting physical activity when prescribing this class of antidepressants.",2021-03-01,2023-04-06 13:45:17,2023-04-06 13:45:17,2023-04-06 13:45:17,100394,,,20,,Mental Health and Physical Activity,Antidepressant medication use and objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviors in adults,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\AXV7IGRY\St-Amour et al. - 2021 - Antidepressant medication use and objectively meas.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\RZ6HE3CH\S1755296621000144.html,,,Physical activity; Depression; Psychotropic medication; Sedentary behaviors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Montreal (Canada), the demand for this type of service is growing due to population aging. Admissibility to paratransit services is based on various eligibility criteria. Objective The aim of this research is to estimate the share of people residing in Quebec which is eligible for paratransit services and to estimate the latent demand (number of eligible people) for the STM (Montreal transit authority) paratransit service. Methods To determine the share of people eligible for the paratransit services, a filter algorithm has been developed based on eligibility criteria of the Quebec Ministry of Transportation. This algorithm is used to filter the results of the 2017 CSD (Canadian Survey on Disability). The results are applied to the Montreal's population and compared with the current use of the STM paratransit service to estimate a latent eligible population. Results In Quebec, 5% (296,130) of the population is considered eligible for paratransit services based on the filter algorithm. In Montreal, 1.7% (23,787) of people are STM paratransit users. This represents only 33% of the eligible population. So, the latent eligible population of the STM paratransit service amounts to more than 50,000 people. Conclusion Mobility of PWDs has an important impact on social inclusion and access to opportunities. Therefore, it is essential to identify the eligible population and to understand why eligible people are not using the provided services.",2022-12-01,2023-04-06 13:44:57,2023-04-06 13:44:57,2023-04-06 13:44:57,101512,,,27,,Journal of Transport & Health,Short report,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\LDYW76VQ\Garnier et al. - 2022 - Short report An algorithm based on the Canadian s.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\6VITN9WB\S2214140522001840.html,,,Paratransit; People with disabilities; Eligibility; Filter algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subjective measure is based on the individual's perception of the match of his/her education level, training and experience with the requirements of his/her job; and the objective measure assesses the match between the individual's educational attainment and the skill level associated with his/her occupational group. Findings The results show that only the “the fish fitting the pond, but feeling cramped” and “the aware big fish in a small pond” profiles of overqualified workers lead to a lower probability of being satisfied with their job compared to “fish that fits the pond.” Originality/value The current study is original because the findings reveal that being objectively overqualified without feeling cramped has no consequence on workers' job satisfaction, while feeling cramped without being objectively overqualified leads to lower job satisfaction. Recruiters should therefore avoid to focus on overeducation since it has no impact on their job satisfaction. They should pay more attention to the feeling of being cramped when they look for the best candidates. Even if the candidate's diploma corresponds to that required by the position, this feeling reduces their chances to be satisfied with the job.",2021-01-01,2023-04-06 13:43:55,2023-04-06 13:43:55,2023-04-06 13:43:55,446-460,,2,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\XSNAZD5U\Boulet - 2021 - Profiling the “big fish in a small pond” and exami.pdf,,,Job satisfaction; Objective overqualification; Perceived overqualification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alarmingly, increases in incidence and mortality were noted globally for this malignancy, despite increase in understanding of melanoma pathogenesis and enhanced prevention efforts.MethodsData was extracted for CM patients for provinces and territories (except Quebec) using two independent, population-based registries. Analysis was performed using both clinical and pathological characteristics: tumor morphologic classification, age, sex, anatomic site affected and place of residence. Mortality trends were assessed over a 7-year period. Results were compared to prior findings for 1992–2010.ResultsDuring 2011–2017 39,610 patients were diagnosed with CM, with 5,890 reported deaths. National crude CM incidence was 20.75 (age-standardized incidence: 14.12) cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Females accounted for 45.8% of cases and 37.1% of deaths. While CM incidence rates continue to increase in both sexes, since 2013 the CM mortality is declining. We observed important differences across the provinces/territories, where Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, southern Ontario/British Columbia and certain coastal communities of New Brunswick demonstrated higher CM incidence and mortality rates. The observed incidence and mortality trends for 2011–2017 validate and extend earlier observations from 1992 to 2010 for CM.ConclusionThis population-based study highlights that while melanoma's incidence is increasing in Canada, mortality rates are for the first time decreasing since 2013.

In Canada, unmarried cohabitation becomes a legal status after one year of relationship. Most provinces automatically expand couples’ rights and responsibilities after several years of cohabitation: some provinces allow cohabiting partners to claim for alimony upon separation, while others consider cohabiting couples to be equal to married couples. Using cross-province variations in legal settings and minimum eligibility duration, we find that eligibility for a regime making cohabiting partners equal to married partners increases men’s labour supply and earnings and decreases women’s while eligibility for a regime allowing for post-separation transfers between ex-partners decreases women’s earnings only. We find that the effect is stronger for couples directly eligible at the time of the reform than for couples who are eligible after the reform and may have anticipated changes in the legal settings. Our results show that eligibility affects within-household allocation of earnings and hours of work, and reinforces existing inequality.

The 1996 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort is a nationally representative sample of Canadian adults, followed up for cancer incidence and mortality from 1996 to 2015. For this analysis, we excluded participants who lived in major Canadian cities (with a population size greater than 1·5 million people), recent immigrants, and individuals younger than 25 years or 90 years of age or older at baseline. Exposures to wildfires were assigned on the basis of area burned within a 20 km or 50 km radius of residential locations and updated for annual residential mobility. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between exposure to wildfires and specific cancers associated with carcinogenic compounds released by wildfires, including lung and brain cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukaemia, adjusted for many personal and neighbourhood-level covariates. Findings Our analyses included more than 2 million people followed up for a median of 20 years, for a total of 34 million person-years. Wildfire exposure was associated with slightly increased incidence of lung cancer and brain tumours. For example, cohort members exposed to a wildfire within 50 km of residential locations in the past 10 years had a 4·9% relatively higher incidence (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·049, 95% CI 1·028–1·071) of lung cancer than unexposed populations, and a 10% relatively higher incidence (adjusted HR 1·100, 1·026–1·179) of brain tumours. Similar associations were observed for the 20 km buffer size. Wildfires were not associated with haematological cancers in this study, and concentration-response trends were not readily apparent when area burned was modelled as a continuous variable. Interpretation Long-term exposure to wildfires might increase the risk of lung cancer and brain tumours. Further work is needed to develop long-term estimates of wildfire exposures that capture the complex mixture of environmental pollutants released during these events.

The empirical literature finds that individuals with higher levels of education experience lower risks of poor health outcomes compared to individuals with less education. Outstanding to this literature is the examination of a dimension of education – literacy – and its association with health. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between literacy (reading, numeracy) and health (self-reported health). We use data from the 2012 wave of the Canadian Longitudinal International Survey of Adults (LISA). The LISA includes rich information on health, broader sociodemographic characteristics (income, age, sex, etc.) as well as information on literacy skills from the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Using logistic regression, we first reaffirm the association between education and self-reported health. We then find that after controlling for measures of literacy, understood as proficiency in reading and numeracy, the magnitude of effect of education on health is reduced. Skills in literacy reduce the risk of reporting poor health, but only for the older subset of respondents (ages 40–65). Our results suggest that literacy should not be understated in empirical research on education and health, and in fact serve to sharpen our understanding of how education impacts health by drawing attention to indirect pathways.",2022-03-01,2023-04-06 13:41:55,2023-04-06 13:41:55,2023-04-06 13:41:55,101038,,,17,,SSM - Population Health,Literacy and self-rated health,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\LIPVD2UD\MacDonald et al. - 2022 - Literacy and self-rated health Analysis of the Lo.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\9ZR5RR74\S2352827322000179.html,,,Education; Older adults; Life course; Literacy; Self-reported health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We followed a population-based cohort of 2.7 million adults across Canada from 2007 through 2016. For each participant, we estimated annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 and the fractional contributions to PM2.5 from the five leading anthropogenic sources at their residential address using satellite observations in combination with a global atmospheric chemistry transport model. For each source, we estimated the causal effects of six hypothetical interventions on 10-y nonaccidental mortality risk using the parametric g-formula, a structural causal model. We conducted stratified analyses by age, sex, and income. This cohort would have experienced tangible health gains had contributions to PM2.5 from any of the five sources been reduced. Compared with no intervention, a 10% annual reduction in PM2.5 contributions from transportation and power generation, Canada’s largest and fifth-largest anthropogenic sources, would have prevented approximately 175 (95%CI: 123–226) and 90 (95%CI: 63–117) deaths per million by 2016, respectively.

Moreover, the findings indicate that those who identify as women are significantly more likely to report their partner emotionally or financially abused them and threatened or mistreated their pet(s); the connection between animal maltreatment and IPV is particularly pronounced for emotional IPV when compared with other forms of IPV; challenge the commonplace conceptualization of animal abuse as a form of property abuse; and suggest a need for a more nuanced understanding of IPV perpetrators vis-à-vis animal maltreatment.

I find that the 2008 increase in Canada and the 1995 increase in the American state of Georgia led to substantial decreases in the fraction of births arising from partnerships made illegal. These impacts reflect net decreases in births and falling abortions rather than changes in reporting, implying decreased pregnancy rates. Further evidence suggests that the laws deterred relationships between teens and targeted partners altogether and I also uncover a strong response to the law through marriage of teens aged 14 to 15 in Georgia, which then provided a loophole because age of consent laws did not apply to married couples.",2022,2023-05-02 20:15:42,2023-05-02 20:15:42,2023-05-02 20:15:42,1431-1459,,3,55,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/caje.12612,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\9B8A489F\Lepage - 2022 - Do age of consent laws decrease teen births.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\4RENNBB3\caje.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Households in the Atlantic provinces faced the most energy poverty and highest energy expenditures. Low income, geography, and dwelling conditions were the main predictors of energy poverty. Households in energy poverty also spent approximately five times more on energy expenditures as a proportion of their total expenditures compared to households not in energy poverty.

Further, our study's robust quantitative estimates allow benchmarking and comparative research.

Providing a conceptualization for energy poverty and vulnerability, which lack a formal legislative definition in Canadian policy, the paper discusses the history of Ontario's energy sector and the levels of ‘energy burden’ that brought energy prices to the fore of the public debate. It then reviews 40 initiatives that have assisted energy poor or energy vulnerable households, largely within broader policy areas of energy efficiency and energy savings, housing provision, poverty reduction, healthcare, and climate change mitigation. These initiatives are categorized into three main thematic areas of 1) financial support, 2) energy efficiency and savings, and 3) consumer protection. Further analysis shows that the initiatives largely address short-term needs and focus on the symptoms of energy poverty and vulnerability, rather than on preventative measures.

This is especially true for immigrants, who have had lower homeownership rates than the Canadian-born since the 1980s. This paper investigates the impacts of housing affordability and the three elements of the housing pathways framework—economic resources, family composition, and cultural variations—on household formation and homeownership differences between five racialized immigrant groups and the Canadian-born. Using Public Use Census data and a “difference in difference” analytical approach, we assess the housing progress of six groups (five foreign-born, one native-born) between 2006 and 2016. We find that housing affordability does not hinder immigrants in forming independent households, suggesting that many immigrants may be willing to earmark a greater share of their incomes to live independently in either rented or owned accommodations.

Alongside recent changes in age composition, educational attainment, marital trends, and immigration, Canadian internal migration has widely been in decline. In this context, our project investigates the demographic determinants of Canadian provincial migration and the correlation between Canada’s socio-demographic shifts and the decline of inter-provincial migration. To do so, our analysis consists of two identical multivariate logistic regressions and an econometric decomposition using the data of the 1991 and 2016 Canadian Census Public Use Microdata Files. The dependent variable is inter-provincial migration, and the focal independent variables are age, educational attainment, marital status, immigrant status, and province of residence five years ago. By investigating how these determinants are associated with migration, we develop a greater understanding of how demographics predict inter-provincial migration in Canada, and how these demographics have changed and affected the overall decline in inter-provincial migration. In a broad sense, we examine the continuity of contemporary demographic trends in their relation to Canadian macro-economic human capital distribution. Through our investigation, we conclude that while compositional changes have some impact, it is a shift in the effects of these changes that largely explains the decline in Canadian inter-provincial migration.",2021-09-01,2023-05-02 19:45:40,2023-05-02 19:45:40,2023-05-02 19:45:40,331-359,,3,9,,Migration Studies,The demographic determinants of inter-provincial migration declines in Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\HMI9KHJ9\6290668.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study utilized three waves (2016-2018) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), as well as residential greenness data from the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Consortium (CANUE). Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore variation in the pattern of substance use between greenness quartiles. The sample included 14,070 youth and young adults (15-25 years). RESULTS: Residential greenness was not associated with alcohol use in general but was associated with lower odds of frequent binge drinking. Residential greenness was also associated with lower odds of tobacco use and greater odds of marijuana use. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that residential greenness is associated with patterns of substance use.

To this end, our analyses focus on explaining the industrial effects on bladder, kidney and prostate cancer. Methods: Data were obtained from a population-based linked dataset, Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort. Approximately 2.7 million people aged 25 or older who responded to the 1991 long-form Census questionnaire were linked with the Canadian Cancer Registry. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis between June 4, 1991, and December 31, 2010. Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to predict incidences of cancer with the agricultural industry as a reference point. Sex-specific analyses were then carried out. Results: Bladder cancer was diagnosed in 6970 men and 1665 women. The real estate industry was associated with increased risk for both sexes (men: hazard ratio [HR] 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.62, p<0.01; women: HR 1.63; 95% CI: 1.12-2.37, p< 0.05). Kidney cancer incidence was 4380 men and 1900 women. Health and social service was the only industry with increased risk for both men (HR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04-1.62, p<0.05) and women (HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01-1.83, p<0.05).

A number of industries had a lower risk of prostate cancer diagnoses, such as accommodation and food (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.70-0.84, p<0.0001), when compared to the agriculture industry. Conclusions: Multivariate analysis, controlling for socioeconomic factors, found effects of real estate industry and health and social service consistently for both sexes in bladder and kidney cancer diagnosis, respectively.

Interaction matrixes are developed and mapped to analyse both the broad geographical structure of interprovincial HESM and the impact of language, specifically student mother tongue, in shaping migration patterns. In both the overall picture of HESM and that of mother tongue, HESM generates expected patterns as well as important migration variations. Ontario and Quebec anchor the national picture and, together with others, constitute exchanges amongst contiguous provincial clusters. Unique cross-country interprovincial connections are also revealed and migration by mother tongue generates further nuances still.

To investigate this issue, we conduct empirical analysis, using data from Statistics Canada's Longitudinal Administrative Databank, which contains annual TFSA and RRSP contributions for a sample of 20 percent of all Canadian taxfilers.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how the consumption of VFPs relates to usual nutrient intakes in the Canadian population. DESIGN: The 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey comprises single 24-h dietary intake recalls on a population-representative sample of 20,487 individuals aged 1 year and older, with second recalls on a subset of 7,608. The intake data included 15 food codes denoting VFP (e.g. energy drinks, fortified beverages, cereals, and bars). We assessed VFP consumption and estimated usual intake distributions for riboflavin, niacin, zinc, and vitamins A, B6, B12, and C for VFP consumers and non-consumers 14-50 years old (n = 8,442) using the National Cancer Institute method. We applied the 'shrink and add' method to estimate usual intakes among supplement users and assessed apparent benefits and risks by comparing usual intake distributions to EARs and ULs. RESULTS: Only 2.4% of the population reported any consumption of VFP on the first 24-h recall. VFP consumers were overrepresented in the upper quartile of population intake distributions for niacin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and zinc. The median usual intakes of VFP consumers were 24-111% higher than the median usual intakes of non-consumers, and VFP consumers had significantly lower prevalence of inadequacy for riboflavin and vitamins A, B6, B12, and C. Irrespective of VFP consumption, usual intake distributions reached the ULs for vitamin A and zinc with the addition of supplement intakes. DISCUSSION: Given the limited differentiation of VFP in this survey, we have likely underestimated nutrient exposure levels. CONCLUSIONS: VFP consumption was associated with elevated usual nutrient intakes, but we found limited evidence that it protected consumers from nutrient inadequacies or propelled intakes above tolerable upper levels.",2021,2023-05-02 19:20:58,2023-05-02 19:20:58,,,,,65,,Food Nutr Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 34650396 PMCID: PMC8494267,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\PAER7UYT\Tarasuk and Brassard - 2021 - The effect of consuming voluntarily fortified food.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650396,,Canada; dietary assessment; National Cancer Institute Method; usual intakes; voluntary fortification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from the nationally representative data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003, 2015–2016, 2018 cycles) (N = 30,729), the independent associations between age, sex, marital status, immigrant status, race/ethnicity, education, income, rurality, affective health and the use of illicit substances, opioids (without distinction for prescription status), problematic levels of alcohol, and combined past-year use (≥2) of substances, were explored using multivariate logistic regression, marginal risk, and population attributable fraction estimation, with propensity score-adjusted sensitivity analyses. Males, those who were under 29 years, without a partner, born in Canada, White, or had an affective disorder reported both higher use of individual substances and multiple substances in the past year. Social determinants appear to explain a substantial proportion of substance use patterns overall. Between 10% and 45% of illicit substance, problematic alcohol, and polysubstance use prevalence was attributable to non-partnered marital status, non-immigrant status, and White race/ethnicity. Of opioid use prevalence, 25% was attributable to White race/ethnicity, 13% to affective disorder status and 4% to lower-income. Though not all substance use will result in substance-related morbidity or mortality, these findings highlight the role of social determinants in shaping the intermediary behavioural outcomes that shape population-level risk of “deaths of despair”.",2022-11-01,2023-05-02 19:19:12,2023-05-02 19:19:12,2023-05-02 19:19:12,107327,,,164,,Preventive Medicine,The social determinants of substance use associated with deaths of despair,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\3J8B7V9Y\S0091743522003772.html,,,Canada; Social determinants of health; Alcohol drinking; Health equity; Illicit drugs; Opioid epidemic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study estimated full compliance to Canada's voluntary sodium reduction guidance (SRG) targets on social inequities and population sodium intake. Methods: We conducted a modeling study using n = 19,645, 24 h dietary recalls (Canadians ≥ 2 years) from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition (2015 CCHS-N). Multivariable linear regressions were used to estimate mean sodium intake in measured (in the 2015 CCHS-N) and modelled (achieving SRG targets) scenarios across education, income and food security. The percentage of Canadians with sodium intakes above chronic disease risk reduction (CDRR) thresholds was estimated using the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) method. Results: In children aged 2-8, achieving SRG targets reduced mean sodium intake differences between food secure and insecure households from 271 mg/day (95%CI: 75,468) to 83 mg/day (95%CI: -45,212); a finding consistent across education and income. Mean sodium intake inequities between low and high education households were eliminated for females aged 9-18 (96 mg/day, 95%CI: -149,341) and adults aged 19 and older (males: 148 mg/day, 95%CI: -30,327; female: -45 mg/day, 95%CI: -141,51).

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 19,742 respondents of single-day 24-h dietary recalls in the nationally representative 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition. Poisson regressions were used to estimate the prevalence of consuming each beverage type on a given day. Among consumers on a given day, linear regressions were used to estimate mean energy intake. Models included household education, food security and income quintiles as separate unadjusted exposures. Sex-specific models were estimated separately for children/adolescents (2-18 years) and adults (19 +). RESULTS: Among female children/adolescents, the prevalence of consuming sugary drinks and, separately, SSB ranged from 11 to 21 and 8 to 27 percentage-points higher among lower education compared to 'Bachelor degree or above' households. In female adults, the prevalence of consuming sugary drinks and, separately, SSB was 10 (95% CI: 1, 19) and 14 (95% CI: 2, 27) percentage-points higher in food insecure compared to secure households. In males, the prevalence of consuming 100% juice was 9 (95% CI: - 18, 0) percentage-points lower among food insecure compared to secure households. Social inequities in energy intake were observed in female adult consumers, among whom mean energy from sugary drinks was 27 kcal (95% CI: 3, 51) higher among food insecure compared to secure and 35 kcal (95% CI: 2, 67) higher from 100% juice among 'less than high school' education compared to 'Bachelor degree or above' households.

This study aimed to assess the determinants of the ethno-racial differences in the use of substances that underlie these deaths. METHODS: Using nationally representative data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003, 2015-2016, 2018 cycles), a decomposition analysis was performed to estimate the contribution of psychosocial determinants, including age, sex, marital status, immigration, education, income, rurality, and affective health on inequalities between White and non-White populations in illicit substance, opioid, and problematic alcohol use and combined use (≥ 2) of substances. RESULTS: Overall, White respondents reported higher levels (by 5% to 10%) of substance use than non-White peers. Over 30% of the ethno-racial inequalities in illicit substance, problematic alcohol, and polysubstance use are explained by the protective role of immigration among those who are not White, whose low levels of substance use lower the prevalence in the non-White population overall. Among those born in Canada, no ethno-racial differences in substance use were observed. CONCLUSION: Social determinants, particularly immigrant status, explain a substantial proportion of ethno-racial inequalities in substance use in Canada.

Differences in ethno-specific penalties due to national cultural frames ? related to multiculturalism in Canada and secular republicanism in France ? are small, affect only the second generation, and are related both to minority household patterns and to treatment in mainstream institutions. Using data on household incomes from two large-scale surveys (Trajectories and Origins in France 2008?2009 and the Canadian National Household Survey 2011) and taking account of cross-setting differences in Muslim and other minority origins, we model cross-generational economic trajectories reflecting the impact of immigrant selectivity, labor market structures, and welfare transfers. Within this framework, we examine four ways that cultural frames may affect minority economic disadvantage: the significance of religion relative to race, citizenship access, labor market discrimination, and minority household patterns, including employment of women in couples and intergenerational cohabitation. Across all minorities, we find a striking cross-national difference in intergenerational economic trajectories: flat in France and upward in Canada, plausibly reflecting institutional differences. Net of sociodemographic controls, both religion and race matter in each setting, and net Muslim disadvantage is similar in each. Citizenship differences have little impact. Labor market earnings discrimination appears similar. A small potential effect of cultural frames appears in second-generation Muslim households: in France, lower female employment rates reduce household incomes, while in English-speaking Canada, more frequent cohabitation with more affluent parents increases household incomes.

Our results show that the average RR of public pensions for individuals in bad health is 32 percent, whereas for those who report being in good health, it is 21 percent. When public pensions and C/QPP benefits are included, these percentages become 54 percent for those in bad health and 41 percent for those in good health.

We find that the employment probability of forestry industry workers decreased by 3.8 percentage points following the crisis relative to other workers in comparable industries. While one would expect younger forestry workers to return to school in such circumstances, we find that in the first two years following the crisis, unemployed workers did not go back to school. However, going back to school takes time, and after 3 to 4 years, we find that education enrolment increases by 2.9 percentage points, with a stronger effect on younger individuals (7.8 p.p.).

Financial confidence is found not to track actual financial skills very closely across different ages, espe¬cially for women, and at older ages.

Using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, confidence is also found to explain 14.15% of the gender gap in financial literacy, while being self-employed explains 19% of the gap, and taking part in the financial planning accounts for 16.76% of the gender gap difference.

Limited access to low-cost facilities was associated with lower odds of meeting physical activity guidelines (OR = 0.85 [0.73,0.98], p = 0.030) regardless of location, but was reported more commonly as a barrier by rural males (27.3 % vs 8.6 % urban) and females (30.0 % vs 9.1 % urban). Inadequate social support was associated with lower odds of meeting physical activity guidelines in females (OR = 0.79 [0.66,0.94], p =.009), but not males (OR = 0.99 [0.84,1.17], p =.931). Individual-level barriers such as time, costs, enjoyment, and confidence were associated with meeting physical activity guidelines for both rural and urban residents. Social-environmental factors appear to be the main contributors to physical activity inequities between rural and urban residents. Interventions designed to bolster social connectedness may support physical activity engagement for people living in rural communities.",2022-12-01,2023-05-02 16:16:30,2023-05-02 16:16:30,2023-05-02 16:16:30,102061,,,30,,Preventive Medicine Reports,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\4J3294U7\Pelletier et al. - 2022 - Rural-urban differences in individual and environm.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\PEUS9MUP\S2211335522003680.html,,,Exercise; Physical activity; Barriers; Rural-urban disparities; Social-ecological model; Socioecological model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from the 2006 and 2016 population censuses were pooled and linked to a continuous geospatial remoteness index for assessing trends in occupational feminization and associated employment earnings among degree-holding professionals aged 25–54. Linear regression and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methods were used to analyze how personal, professional, and socioenvironmental factors may attenuate or magnify wage differentials by sex. Results show the STEM professions tended to remain male-dominated, heavily urbanized, and subject to significantly lower earnings for women compared to men. Other historically female-dominated professions, notably nursing professionals and secondary school teachers, were characterized with geographic distributions most closely approaching the general population, relatively narrower gender wage gaps, but also lower average annual earnings. A significant gender wage differential was found in each profession, with women earning 4.6‒12.5% less than men, after adjusting for traditional human capital measures, social characteristics intersecting with gender, and community remoteness and accessibility. Residential remoteness and census period generally explained little of the gender wage gap.

This population-based cohort study sought to advance understanding on the associations of contextual characteristics and risk of diabetes-related avoidable hospitalization (DRAH) among at-risk Canadians. Data and methods A national cohort was compiled from the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey, representing 5.1 million adults aged 35 years and older reporting having been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension or heart disease. Their information was linked longitudinally to hospitalization data from the 2013/14 to 2017/18 Discharge Abstract Database as well as to measures of geographic variability from the Material and Social Deprivation Index and the Index of Remoteness. Cox regression models were used to examine associations between the contextual indices and first occurrence of a DRAH. Results Residents in the most rural and remote communities were 50% more likely (hazard ratio (HR): 1.51, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.26 to 1.80) to experience a DRAH than those in the most urbanized and accessible communities, and residents in the most socially deprived areas were significantly more likely (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.65) to be hospitalized than those in the most socially privileged areas, controlling for individuals' sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviours. Neighbourhood material deprivation did not exercise a statistically significant influence on hospitalization risk after adjusting for the other residential characteristics.

La contribution de ces scientifiques est aujourd’hui malmenée, notamment à cause de certains médias sociaux, par l’émergence d’une forme d’incrédulité, voire de rejet, à l’égard des études statistiques, comme en témoigne l’apparition de nouveaux concepts tels la « post-vérité », les « faits alternatifs » et autres « dérèglements du marché de l’information ». Pourtant, c’est en tenant compte de ce que dit la science que nous pouvons vraiment documenter les grands enjeux démographiques, les comprendre et parfois suggérer des pistes de solution. Les 37 spécialistes de la démographie, de la sociologie ou de l’histoire réunis ici abordent de façon claire, précise et concise, des questions souvent cruciales, voire incontournables.

We estimate differences in the time that immigrant and Canadian-born parents allocate to child-care activities relative to other activities using the time diaries from the General Social Survey. We find that mothers born abroad spend more time at work and less time in leisure but there is no significant difference in time devoted to household production or child service between them and Canadian-born mothers. Despite not finding differences by immigration status in the total care-time parents provide for their children, we do find significant differences - by immigrant status - in time specifically devoted to human capital investment activities with children: African, Asian, European and South-Central American mothers spend up to 30 more minutes daily in these activities than the Canadian born. We further assess the patterns of time use of second-generation young adults and find that they spend more time on education and homework compared to third generation or higher young adults. This supports a plausible effect of the time invested in children’s human capital generating activities by immigrant parents on their Canadian-born children.",2022,2023-05-16 17:56:53,2023-05-16 17:59:36,,,,,,,,,Working Paper Series,,,,Canadian Labour Economics Forum,Waterloo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLEF WP 48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UGSJYK66,preprint,2022,"Staubli, Stefan; Zhao, Qiongda",The Long-Run and Distributional Impacts of Public Pensions,,,,,,"Raising the early eligibility age (EEA) for old-age pensions is a popular policy to reduce financial pressure on pension systems. A mature literature has investigated the short-run impact of the EEA on labor supply, but knowing the EEA’s long-run impact on economic well-being and poverty is essential for welfare. This paper addresses this gap by studying two Canadian pension reforms that reduced the EEA from age 65 to 60. The reforms took place in the 1980s, enabling us to follow affected individuals over their entire retirement period. Using comprehensive tax records and a variety of research designs, we obtain three findings. First, a one-year reduction in the EEA lowers the pension claiming age by 0.25 years but does not affect the labor market exit age. Second, early claiming increases pension and total income between age 60 and 64, but pension and income losses after age 65 overshadow these gains. Third, lowering the EEA has significant distributional consequences: the losses in pension and total income are concentrated among richer retirees. In contrast, low-income retirees experience an improvement in later-life economic well-being. Overall, the EEA reduction in the 1980s is associated with a significant decline in poverty rates in Canada.",2022-08,2023-05-16 16:03:49,2023-05-16 16:04:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Calgary,en,,Working Paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\74D3BV3Y\Staubli and Zhao - The Long-Run and Distributional Impacts of Public .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We ﬁnd the dispersion of marginal returns to both capital and labour across ﬁrms have increased signiﬁcantly during this period, suggesting allocative eﬃciency is deteriorating. Using a rich but tractable multi-sector model of heterogeneous ﬁrms, we ﬁnd this rising misallocation accounts for over three-quarters of the increased productivity gap between Canada and the United States over this period.

QBKK2FUS,preprint,2022,"Notten, Geranda; Tuz Zohora, Fatima; Plante, Charles; Laforest, Rachel",Two decades of poverty reduction politics in Canada: Better for single parent families and single working age adults?,,,,,http://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/43745,"Over the past two decades, poverty reduction entered and often stayed on the political agenda of Canada’s jurisdictions, generating a trail of government reports documenting many actions and spanning multiple election cycles. This paper investigates whether this social inclusion-oriented policy environment improved the position of single parent families and single working age adults, two groups at particularly high risk of experiencing poverty. They are also more likely to face multiple barriers making it harder for them to avoid or escape poverty. Using microdata from the Canadian Income Survey (CIS) and its predecessor (1999-2017), we analyze poverty changes in a relative sense (compared to the typical Canadian) and an absolute sense (purchasing power). Our model controls for changes in demographic and regional characteristics and uses households consisting of multiple working age adults as a reference. Against the backdrop of substantive declines in absolute poverty with little change in relative poverty levels for Canada as a whole, we find that the poverty disadvantage declined for both groups. However, although improvements for single parent families have been strong and widespread, improvements for single adults of working age have been smaller and were more concentrated in provinces experiencing stronger economic growth. These results support the claim that governments prioritize the inclusion of families with dependent children while the inclusion of single working age adults is largely left to the fortunes of the economy. Notwithstanding the progress documented here, poverty rates of these high poverty risk groups remain far above Canada’s average and single working age adults continue to experience deeper than average poverty gaps.",2022-06,2023-05-16 15:56:52,2023-05-16 15:57:45,2023-05-16 15:56:52,,,,,,,Two decades of poverty reduction politics in Canada,,,,,,Ottawa,en,,Working Paper,,,ruor.uottawa.ca,,Accepted: 2022-06-29T19:35:48Z,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\ISM5W8A3\Notten et al. - 2022 - Two decades of poverty reduction politics in Canad.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All residents of Slave Lake, except firefighters and the police force, were forced to evacuate to nearby municipalities for at least a month. In this study, we use longitudinal income tax data from 2004 to 2018, to examine the short, medium, and long-term effect of this wildfire on affected individuals. We find that the wildfire led to a drop in total income of 9.5% on average in the seven years following the wildfire, mainly explained by a decrease in employment income. Effects are concentrated in males, and workers in the forestry and agriculture and oil and gas sectors.

More specifically, we aim to provide novel results on whether the rate of income growth over age is higher among children of more or less privileged social origins in Canada, and what factors may account for eventual differences. Among those factors, we examine the role of education, as well as factors related to the early adult life course, post labour market entry, including parenthood and couple status. We find that although inequalities based on parental income levels are observed in the early life course, they are exacerbated by the steeper income growth experienced by children of higher income parents between 22 and 35 years old, especially among men. While these patterns seem to be associated with differences in educational attainment, we also find an important role for labour force attachment over the early life course. We find significant gender differences in these patterns, driven in part by flatter income growth among more privileged women compared with more privileged men. This last pattern is in part driven by the negative association between parenthood and income among women, and gender differences in labour force attachment.",2022-04-19,2023-05-16 15:52:08,2023-05-16 15:54:15,2023-05-16 15:52:08,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Toronto,Toronto,en_ca,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Public Policy Reports,,,tspace.library.utoronto.ca,,Accepted: 2022-07-25T13:31:33Z,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\5X6HM7E4\St-Denis and Yang - 2022 - Intergenerational Transmission of Socio-Economic S.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In turn, these firms experience 5.2 percent, 0.4 percentage points, and 890 dollars increases in their sales, profit margins, and EBITDA per worker. Furthermore, annual earnings increase by 1.3 percent for workers in treated firms relative to workers in control firms. We estimate that workers without ownership in their own firms bear about a third of corporate tax burdens, and combined workers (with or without ownership) bear about three quarters of the tax burdens. Additionally, the effects are larger for firms and workers in high-growth and high-tech industries, suggesting a cash-flow channel playing an important role behind our results.

In Canada, several important benefits aimed at low-income families are delivered through the tax system, but only to those who file tax returns. Furthermore, the tax system is frequently used to verify eligibility for a wide range of income-tested public goods and services. As we pointed out in a previous article (Robson & Schwartz, 2020) up to 12 percent of Canadians do not complete tax returns. Those who do not file are disproportionately those with low incomes and many miss out on cash benefits and public programs for which they are eligible.One way to get those benefits to their intended recipients would be for the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to absorb more of the administrative burden of initiating and completing tax returns on behalf of low-income individuals and families. To do so, however, given the current Canadian tax system, might require a wider range of third-party information or a set of administrative changes. In this paper, we estimate how many families have simple returns that the CRA could readily complete with information it already collects from third parties. Our calculations are based on the family-level variables constructed by Statistics Canada for the Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD), a 20% sample of all tax returns.We conclude that the CRA, if so directed, could complete returns for two-thirds of the families with income from provincial social assistance programs. And we estimate that collecting third-party information from new sources or instituting alternative administrative procedures could substantially increase the number of returns that the CRA could complete. We conclude there is a reasonable pathway for the tax agency in Canada to do much more to reduce the administrative burden imposed by the current tax filing system and a strong case for it to do so.",2023-04-01,2023-05-16 15:08:44,2023-05-16 15:08:44,2023-05-16 15:08:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\CXBI2T9I\Genest-Grégoire et al. - 2023 - What Proportion of Tax Returns Could the Canada Re.pdf,,,Canada; welfare; low-income; administrative burden; automatic-filing; tax; tax agency; transfers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4428147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenge, however, is that not much of the existing research focuses specifically on refugee women and their unique experiences beyond mental and physical health. My dissertation contributes to addressing this gap by examining their successes and challenges in the Canadian labour market. Using the 2016 version of the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), this dissertation addresses the question: What are the characteristics that predict economic success among refugee women in Canada? A secondary question asks, to what extent does arriving during an economic recession influence the income of refugee women? This dissertation uses Critical Race theory, Intersectional theory and Segmented Labour Market theory informed by a quantitative research design to address these questions. These theoretical perspectives help to understand the findings suggesting that the barriers in the Canadian labour market help to sustain existing racism, discrimination and inequality refugee women experience.    The findings indicate that the level of education at arrival for refugee women in Canada varies. Based on the sample population in my dataset and existing research, there are large numbers of refugee women with low levels of education compared to those with graduate-level education and of those with university degrees. A significant number (62%), however, have skilled and technical education and work experiences prior to their arrival to Canada. In addition, the most dominant skill level among refugee women in Canada is elemental labour followed by intermediate labour and clerical skills. Very few refugee women (mainly those aged between 35 to 49 years) arrive in Canada with managerial and professional skills. Education is an important predictor of the employment income of refugee women in Canada according to the results of the multivariate analysis. The findings in this study, not surprisingly, reveal that refugee women with university degrees earn significantly more than those with a high school diploma or less. As time in Canada and education levels increase, so does the chances of earning an income that is higher than median employment income. Arriving during a recession (2008) does not seem to have an influence on their wages in the long-term. In the short term, however, there is a decline in wages and income three and six years after arrival for groups who arrived during the latest recession.",2022-06-24,2023-05-12 20:18:52,2023-05-12 20:19:33,2023-05-12 20:18:52,,,,,,,Measuring success,,,,,University of Manitoba,Winnipeg,eng,info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess,,,,mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca,,Accepted: 2022-07-15T18:43:23Z,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\LJLAW2HE\Ogoe - 2022 - Measuring success predictors of successful econom.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AEFK4IV8,thesis,2022,"Newton, Adam",The Developmental Importance of Napping in Preschool Children,,,,,https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/8969/,"Most children cease napping between 2- and 5-years-old. Little is known about the predictors or outcomes related to this cessation, or the interrelation of different components of nap behavior. Four empirical studies were conducted to investigate the developmental importance of napping among preschool children. Studies 1 and 2 used a large, longitudinal sample of Canadian children to investigate the predictors (Study 1) and outcomes (Study 2) related to early nap cessation. Early nap cessation was defined as stopping daytime sleep before three years old. In Study 1, parents reported on their own, child, and family functioning at two timepoints (0-1 years-old and 2-3 years-old). At 2-3 years-old, ~11% of children had ceased napping. Early nap cessation was predicted by demographic (e.g., female sex), perinatal (e.g., birthweight ≥ 2500 grams), developmental (e.g., more developmental milestones achieved), and sleep-related (i.e., longer nighttime sleep duration) variables. Study 2 presented the evaluation of behavioral and language outcomes related to early nap cessation. After controlling for the predictors identified in Study 1, and other demographic predictors of these outcomes (e.g., income, parental education), early nap cessation predicted higher receptive language and lower anxiety at 4-to-5-years-old. Studies 3 and 4 used representative cross-sectional samples. Study 3 presented the development and psychometric properties of two scales of parents’ nap beliefs – The Parents’ Nap Beliefs Scale and the Reasons Children Nap Scale. In independent pilot (N = 201) and replication samples (N = 702) these scales demonstrated excellent reliability and validity. Study 4 presented an empirical approach to classifying nap behavior (i.e., Latent Profile Analyses) and a prediction of nap behavior using parental beliefs and previously established correlates of nap behavior. Nap behavior was associated with parental beliefs, parents’ own nap behaviors, family functioning, and child nighttime sleep problems. Nap cessation appears to be a developmentally normative process for Canadian preschool children. This process is complex and marked by high intra- and inter-child variability. This complexity is best understood using a socioecological approach which accounts for developmental, demographic, child-parent, and child-environmental factors. Key future directions include replicating these results in non-North American countries and implementing more longitudinal studies.",2022-11-08,2023-05-12 20:17:53,2023-05-12 20:18:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Western Ontario,London,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\QP4Y4D7P\8969.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary method by which accessibility in the home is improved is through the installation of dwelling adaptations, which modify the layout or structure of parts of the home. Measuring the impact these adaptations have on various measures of a household’s dwelling satisfaction will help inform disability and housing legislation, two policy arenas that have seen renewed interest by both provincial and federal governments in recent years after decades of cutbacks to social supports for disabled people.    Using the 2018 Canadian Housing Survey dataset collected by Statistics Canada, Ontario households were split up into three groups; households that need no adaptations, households that need and have adaptations, and households that need but do not have adaptations. Demographic profiles of each group were built and compared. Various measures of dwelling satisfaction were also compared. This was done using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and logistic regression. All households that require a dwelling adaptation had much higher rates of Core Housing Need, rent subsidy, and lived in non-market rental housing compared to non-disabled households. Only half of households requiring adaptations had them. Households that had the adaptations they required had statistically comparable rates of dwelling satisfaction measures to non-disabled households. Households without the adaptations they required were more likely to be women-led, more likely to be led by a young adult, and were more likely to feel unsafe in their home. Adaptations were found to significantly alleviate dissatisfaction with the condition, safety, and accessibility of the home, but adapted households remain in more precarious and substandard housing compared to non-disabled households.",2022-11,2023-05-12 20:02:23,2023-05-12 20:17:37,2023-05-12 20:02:23,,,,,,,,,,,,McMaster University,Hamilton,en,,Thesis,,,macsphere.mcmaster.ca,,Accepted: 2022-09-26T19:05:07Z Journal Abbreviation: DWELLING SATISFACTION OF DISABLED HOUSEHOLDS IN ONTARIO,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\PQA7ARL7\Langdon - 2022 - EVALUATING THE DWELLING SATISFACTION OF HOUSEHOLDS.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2CIFMTSU,thesis,2021,"Zhao, Qiongda",Essays on Public and Labour Economics,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/1880/113890,"This dissertation includes three essays exploring topics related to public and labour Economics. In the first chapter, co-authored with Stefan Staubli, we examine the effect of the early eligibility age (EEA) for old age pensions on a variety of outcomes. While a mature literature has investigated the short-run impact of the EEA on labor supply, evidence on the long-run impacts on economic well-being and poverty is scarce, even though the impact on later-life living standards is crucial to determine the EEA’s welfare effect. This paper helps to fill this gap by studying two Canadian pension reforms that reduced the EEA from age 65 to age 60. The reforms took place in the 1980s, enabling us to follow affected individuals for the entire retirement period until they die. Using comprehensive tax records and a variety of research designs, we obtain three main findings. First, a one-year reduction in the EEA lowered the pension claiming age by 0.25 years but had no effect on the labor market exit age. Second, early claiming increased pension and total income early in retirement but these gains were overshadowed by income losses later in retirement. Third, lowering the EEA had important distributional consequences: the losses in lifetime pension and total income were concentrated among retirees with above-median income, while low-income retirees experienced a significant improvement in later-life economic well-being. Overall, the EEA reduction in the 1980s were associated with a significant decline in elderly bankruptcy and poverty rates in Canada. The second chapter examines the effects of financial incentives on fertility. Children-related benefit is a common policy tool in many countries to reduce the costs of having children and raise fertility. Yet, how the design of benefits affects fertility responses remains less studied. This paper helps to fill this gap by leveraging the introduction of two benefits — a universal benefit and an earnings-related benefit — in the Canadian province of Quebec. Using Canadian administrative tax data and exploiting the variation of benefits across regions and time, I follow a difference-indifferences approach to uncover the fertility responses to the two benefits. The empirical analysis delivers two key results. First, a C$1,000 (2017 prices) spent on universal benefits raises fertility by 3.6% while the same amount spent on earnings-related benefits raises fertility by 2%. Importantly, the increase in fertility reflects an increase in the ultimate number of children rather than a retiming of having children. Second, the large discrepancy in fertility responses is driven by the distributional feature of the two benefits. While universal benefits make larger payments to lowii earnings women who are more responsive to financial incentives, the earnings-related benefits make larger payments to high-earnings women who are less responsive. The last chapter investigates the impact of an expansion in family leave benefits in Canada on mothers’ labor market outcomes after childbirth. I use a regression discontinuity design combined with difference-in-difference design (RD-DD) that compares labor market outcomes of mothers who give birth shortly before and shortly after the date when the policy was in effect. I find that while the extension of cash benefits reduces mothers’ earnings in the short run, the medium- and longrun effects are small and insignificant. Despite the null effects on earnings in the medium- and long-run, a quantile regression analysis suggests that the effects of the family leave expansion are positive in the lower and middle parts of the earnings distribution, and negative in the upper-most part.

Il en est de même pour les étudiants internationaux. Cependant, pour avoir accès à ce revenu potentiel plus élevé, il faut que l’intégration au marché du travail soit réussie par ces derniers. Le système actuel favorise l’immigration des individus au niveau éducatif élevé. Cependant, il n’assure pas l’intégration réussie dans le pays d’accueil, tant au niveau culturel, social ou économique (Kaushik et Drolet, 2018). La pénurie de main-d’œuvre et le vieillissement de la population au Canada accentuent les besoins de travailleurs internationaux venant s’établir ici. Grâce à notre système d’éducation, il est possible d’attirer et de retenir ces étudiants internationaux. Même si une éducation dans le pays d’accueil permet d’améliorer l’intégration, les immigrants font face à des défis plus importants que les nationaux lors de l’entrée sur le marché du travail (Heilbrunn et al, 2010). Donc, il devient crucial de cerner les facteurs qui permettent à ces internationaux d’obtenir un emploi après leurs études.       Ainsi, la question qui demeure est : quels sont les facteurs qui influencent la durée avant d’obtenir le premier emploi auprès des diplômés universitaires internationaux au Canada? À cet effet, nous avons utilisé l’Enquête nationale auprès des diplômés de 2018. Cette enquête est produite par Statistique Canada et vise la cohorte de diplômés de 2015 au Canada. Nous utilisons ainsi plusieurs modèles probit et logit afin d’identifier les facteurs d’influence afin de répondre à notre objectif d’étude.

BLSHEZZN,thesis,2022,"Del Vecchio, Marianne",La qualité de l'emploi et la satisfaction au travail des mères : une comparaison Québec-Ontario,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/11143/19815,"Au Québec, l’égalité entre les sexes est encadrée par la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne. Malgré les lois mises en place, des inégalités persistent entre les hommes et les femmes, révélant généralement ces dernières perdantes d’une telle comparaison (Gouvernement du Québec, 2009a; Laufer, 2005; Moyser, 2017; Statistique Canada, 2018). Ainsi, malgré les législations mises en place et l’augmentation du taux d’activité des femmes sur le marché du travail, des écarts persistent en ce qui concerne le salaire et le taux d’emploi, lorsqu’elles sont comparées aux hommes, se creusant davantage lorsqu’on s’attarde à la population spécifique des mères. Dans l’optique de favoriser de bonnes conditions d’emploi, la province du Québec se distingue de celles du reste du Canada par certaines de ses politiques. C’est le cas du Régime québécois d’assurance parentale (RQAP) qui offre un programme bonifié de l’Assurance emploi, offert ailleurs au Canada. Il en va de même pour le programme de places à contribution réduite en service de garde, exclusivement offert aux Québécois.  La question générale de recherche découlant de la problématique est donc : comment la qualité de l’emploi et la satisfaction au travail des mères québécoises se comparent avec celles des mères des autres provinces canadiennes et à celle des femmes sans enfant? Pour répondre à cette question, les deux provinces comparées sont celles du Québec et de l’Ontario, évitant ainsi d’introduire trop de variabilité dans les contextes des provinces. En effet, le Québec et l’Ontario sont les deux provinces les plus peuplées du Canada (Statistique Canada, 2021b) ayant de surcroit un marché de l’emploi assez semblable (Cloutier-Villeneuve, 2016; Tremblay et al., 2014).  ii  Le cadre de référence de cette recherche permet de détailler les deux concepts fondamentaux sur lesquels repose ce mémoire : la qualité de l’emploi et la satisfaction au travail. Offrant un apport complémentaire, la qualité de l’emploi est mesurée à l’aide de caractéristiques objectives alors que les caractéristiques subjectives sont liées à la satisfaction au travail (Chen et Mehdi, 2018; Cloutier-Villeneuve, 2017).  Au terme du chapitre de la recension des écrits, on constate une documentation scientifique incomplète au sujet de la qualité de l’emploi et de la satisfaction au travail des mères, notamment en comparaison aux femmes sans enfant. Ce mémoire s’attarde à cette zone d’ombre, ayant comme objectif général de comparer les différentes dimensions de la qualité de l’emploi et la satisfaction au travail des mères québécoises à celle des mères en Ontario et des femmes sans enfant de ces deux provinces. Trois hypothèses sont formulées, soit : 1) Au Québec, les mères d’enfants d’âge préscolaire et scolaire sont désavantagées relativement aux autres femmes par rapport à l’ensemble des dimensions de la qualité de l’emploi et à la satisfaction au travail; 2) En Ontario, les mères d’enfants d’âge préscolaire et scolaire sont désavantagées relativement aux autres femmes par rapport à l’ensemble des dimensions de la qualité de l’emploi et à la satisfaction au travail et; 3) Les mères au Québec sont avantagées relativement aux mères en Ontario par rapport à l’ensemble des dimensions de la qualité de l’emploi et à la satisfaction au travail.  Dans le but de vérifier ces hypothèses de recherche, ce mémoire s’appuie sur les données de l’Enquête Sociale Générale : Les Canadiens au travail et à la maison (ESG). Ainsi, l’ESG de 2016 est retenue puisqu’elle traite des Canadiens au travail et à la maison, incluant plusieurs indicateurs pertinents pour l’analyse de la qualité de l’emploi et de la satisfaction au travail. Offrant  iii  un échantillon pondéré de 2 866 507, les ratios d’observations présentées sont à 35,2 % du Québec et 64,8 % de l’Ontario. Compte tenu de l’objet de l’étude, la situation des personnes sans emploi n’est pas prise en compte dans le cadre de ce mémoire.  À terme, les analyses de régression logistique et les analyses de variance montrent qu’au Québec, les mères d’enfant d’âge scolaire sont avantagées relativement aux mères d’enfant d’âge préscolaire quant à la dimension des perspectives; que les mères d’enfants d’âge scolaire de la province du Québec sont avantagées par rapport à celles de l’Ontario sur la dimension des perspectives; que les femmes sans enfant du Québec sont avantagées par rapport à celles de l’Ontario sur la dimension de l’environnement social et; que les femmes sans enfant de la province du Québec sont avantagées sur le plan de la satisfaction globale au travail par rapport à celles de l’Ontario. Les résultats permettent donc d’appuyer partiellement les hypothèses 1 et 3.  Enfin, le projet a permis de documenter la situation des mères au Canada et ce, malgré le nombre limité d’observations non pondérées disponible pour la recherche. Pour le domaine de l’orientation, les facteurs de réalité des mères d’enfants d’âge préscolaire, scolaire et des femmes sans enfant sont à considérer dans le développement de carrière et l’orientation professionnelle « tout au long de la vie ». Ce mémoire se termine en rappelant l’importance de poursuivre la recherche sur la qualité de l’emploi et la satisfaction au travail des mères et des femmes sans enfant.",2022,2023-05-12 20:05:59,2023-05-12 20:16:58,2023-05-12 20:05:59,,,,,,,La qualité de l'emploi et la satisfaction au travail des mères,,,,,Université de Sherbrooke,Sherbrooke,fre,© Marianne Del Vecchio,,,,savoirs.usherbrooke.ca,,Accepted: 2022-10-28T14:26:29Z Publisher: Université de Sherbrooke,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\HVIIMMAV\Del Vecchio - 2022 - La qualité de l'emploi et la satisfaction au trava.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Au Canada, l’employeur désireux de bénéficier de ce programme doit obtenir l’approbation d’une évaluation de l’impact sur le marché du travail. Quant au travailleur étranger temporaire (TET), il lui faut un permis de travail qui précise son employeur. L’objectif de ces restrictions étant la protection de l’emploi des travailleurs locaux, il nous paraît utile d’étudier l’impact de ce programme sur le bien-être de ceux-ci. Nous modifions le modèle de recherche d’emploi d’Acemoglu (2001) pour étudier l’impact du PTET sur le salaire des natifs. Nous apportons deux changements majeurs : nous modélisons les types d’emploi au niveau des conditions de travail (bonnes ou mauvaises) et nous avons deux types de travailleurs, les natifs (libres) et les TET (non libres). Notre contribution est principalement théorique et nous montrons que le PTET pourrait accroître le chômage et baisser le salaire des natifs étant donné que l’augmentation de la fraction de TET induirait la création de plus de mauvais emplois. Nous avons également testé empiriquement nos prédictions. L’estimation d’un modèle de régression à effets fixes du salaire sur la fraction de TET donne un coefficient négatif mais non significatif aux seuils usuels. Cependant, le coefficient sur le premier retard de notre variable explicative d’intérêt est négatif et significatif ; ce qui montre que le salaire des natifs semble avoir un lien plus important avec le flux de TET du mois précédent. En revanche, nous obtenons des résultats négatifs contre-intuitifs pour le chômage et cela pourrait être dû à la qualité de nos données ou bien d’autres raisons qu’il serait utile d’explorer dans des travaux futurs.",2022-12,2023-05-12 20:10:07,2023-05-12 20:16:43,2023-05-12 20:10:07,,,,,,,Intégration de travailleurs (im)migrants sous interdiction de changer d'employeur au pays,,,,,Université du Québec à Montréal,Montréal,fr,,,,,,,"Place: Montréal (Québec, Canada) Publisher: Université du Québec à Montréal",,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\ZTZ9ZFT9\Djossou - 2022 - Intégration de travailleurs (im)migrants sous inte.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\QLB7AHIB\16246.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elle utilise la Plateforme de liens longitudinaux entre l’éducation et le marché du travail (PLEMT). Cette plateforme consiste en l’appariement entre les fichiers administratifs contenus dans le Fichier des familles T1 (FFT1) et le Système d’information sur les étudiants postsecondaires (SIEP) et permet d’évaluer sur une base annuelle la mobilité des diplômés de professions réputées en manque de main-d’œuvre, les sciences de l’éducation ainsi que les sciences infirmières. Nous suivons les diplômés des deux provinces peu importe où ceux-ci déménagent dans le reste du Canada. Nous trouvons que la mobilité des diplômés québécois est très faible comparativement à celle de leurs homologues ontariens et que le Québec bénéficie d’un solde positif entre les sortants et les entrants pour les deux groupes de diplômés. Parmi les diplômés qui ne rapportent plus résider dans leur province d’études, une analyse par modèle logit nous permet d’affirmer que les étudiants ayant reçu une éducation en français sont moins mobiles que ceux ayant fréquenté des institutions anglophones, que le sexe ne semble pas jouer un rôle quant à la mobilité et que les individus vont habituellement déménager dans les premières années suivant l’obtention de leur diplôme. Une analyse par modèle à effets fixes révèle que les diplômés des sciences de l’éducation ayant quitté leur province d’études rapportent des salaires annuels 20% plus élevés que leurs homologues demeurés dans leur province d’études. Les diplômés des sciences infirmières ne semblent pas avoir de hausse significative de leurs revenus. Cette hausse est difficile à déterminer compte tenu du très faible niveau de mobilité des diplômés en sciences infirmières au Québec. Cette hausse est, par contre, presque équivalente à la différence dans le coût de la vie entre les provinces. _____________________________________________________________________________  MOTS-CLÉS DE L’AUTEUR : Mobilité interprovinciale, Revenus, Pénurie de main d’oeuvre, Enseignants, Infirmiers, Québec, Ontario, Modèles à effets fixes",2021-05,2023-05-12 20:12:14,2023-05-12 20:16:39,2023-05-12 20:12:14,,,,,,,,,,,,Université du Québec à Montréal,Montréal,en,,,,,,,"Place: Montréal (Québec, Canada) Publisher: Université du Québec à Montréal",,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\WLQRTEW6\Dionne - 2021 - La mobilité interprovinciale des diplômés des scie.pdf; C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\P5MI6XUN\14939.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chapter 1 examines the labour supply effects of the Working Income Tax Benefit (WITB) in Canada. An in-depth analysis of institutional details surrounding WITB reveals that low-income Canadians lack knowledge of the program. Consequently, WITB can be treated as a lump sum cash transfer rather than as an earnings subsidy. Using variation in WITB receipt both within and between individuals over time, results suggest that, contrary to the predictions of the standard labour-leisure choice model, WITB receipt had a robust, significant positive effect on the labour supply of single low-income workers.",,2023-05-12 20:15:41,2023-05-12 20:16:17,,,Toronto,,,,,,,,,,University of Toronto,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\2W4QMI3I\Koebel - Three Essays on the Social Determinants of Labour .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PP8GMZXJ,thesis,2022,"Uhrig, Richard",Essays in Applied Economics,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/64x1q4qg,"This dissertation contains three chapters in applied economics. Chapter 1 discusses the abolition fo rate bills for public schools in the United States during the 19th century and the resulting impact on primary school attendance. Until the late 19th century, families in some municipalities paid small user fees, called rate bills, for their children to attend public schools. Urban school districts gradually repealed these fees and funded public education through local taxes. States eventually abolished rate bills, forcing rural areas to provide public education without tuition requirements. Using United States Census data and a staggered adoption difference-in-differences approach, I show that state-level rate bill abolition increased rural primary school attendance by 7.2 percentage points. These results suggest that small costs can be an obstacle to school attendance and inhibit the diffusion of education.Chapter 2 discusses the effect of urbanicity on fertility. Fertility rates are significantly lower in urban areas than in rural areas. Using data from the 2016 Canadian Census, I exploit the exogenous placement of refugees to decompose the direct (causal) and indirect (compositional) effects of urbanicity on fertility. I find that these differences persist for refugee women, suggesting that causal factors are primarily responsible for rural-urban differences in fertility.Chapter 3 discusses the effect of fans on home field advantage in European soccer. We exploit exogenous variation in the level of fan attendance driven by COVID-19 mitigation policies and find that the home field advantage, as measured by home minus away (expected) goals, is reduced by more than 50\% across the English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and Spanish La Liga. This leads to a decrease in probability for a home win, indicating that these goals are pivotal with respect to match outcomes. These results are robust to controlling for factors potentially correlated with the no-fans policies, such as changes in weather and COVID-19 prevalence by region.",2022,2023-05-12 20:00:52,2023-05-12 20:00:52,2023-05-12 20:00:52,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Santa Barbara,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\7J73ZWD8\Uhrig - 2022 - Essays in Applied Economics.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from Atlantic Canada,,,,,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/111099,"Atlantic provinces have long suffered from brain drain: young people leaving the area for more and better-paying work elsewhere in Canada. The pressure to leave is especially strong during economic downturns, such as the Great Recession of 2008.     The economic costs of this process are considerable: the break-up of families, the loss of skills, ideas and innovation, and the decline of critical services like health and education.        BUT IS IT WORTH IT TO LEAVE?    Our report, which studies the employment patterns of “Great Recession” graduates for five years, shows that though graduates that stay home initially have lower salaries than those that emigrate, over time their salaries increase faster than the “leavers.” In other words, they eventually catch up to the higher salaries offered in other provinces.    How can these provinces encourage recent graduates to stay?  Our report discusses policy solutions, including adopting higher tuition rates for non-Maritime students, and providing wage subsidies to companies to increase their staff—particularly staff with STEM backgrounds.

In that regard, Canadians face certain challenges: comparative analyses place Canada approximately in the middle of the pack in terms of social mobility levels relative to other developed countries.     Much of the research on social mobility conducted in Canada and elsewhere has focused on the role of education and child development and socialization in that process. But this perspective does not provide a complete picture. We know very little about how advantages—and disadvantages—passed from parents to children play out later in life after adult children enter the labour market. This is a crucial oversight: early adulthood is marked by important events like job mobility, couple formation and parenthood, the impact of which can differ considerably for men and women.     Our study of these intragenerational effects on the later-life outcomes of adult children has documented important mechanisms contributing to the intergenerational transmission of income inequalities in Canada:    The gap in income growth between adult children from higher- and lower-income families widens with age, especially among men.    Canadians born to lower-income parents are more likely to experience frequent spells of joblessness, which contributes to lower income growth in their early adult life course relative to Canadians born in more privileged families.    Women from high-income families are more likely to see their income growth flatten over time, particularly after parenthood. This contrasts with women from lower-income families, whose income growth is on par with their male counterparts.    Our policy brief offers a series of suggestions—beyond educational ones—that can make Canada’s economic landscape more equitable across the life course.

Even when women immigrants are employed, they are more likely to be underemployed, part-time, precarious, and poorly remunerated. The lack of participation of racialized immigrant women in the labour market represents a signiﬁcant economic loss in communities across Canada.  Drawing on an interdisciplinary review of scholarly research, this report synthesizes existing research on the barriers faced by racialized immigrant women in the Canadian labour market. Previous research in this area has been conducted using a largely siloed approach, leaving knowledge gaps and overlooking opportunities to apply lessons learned. Disconnects in research also appear because of changing and disputed deﬁnitions of key terms relating to race and sex, which we discuss at length in Appendix A. In this report, we adopt the broad language of racialized immigrant women, only substituting in other terms like visible minority and ethnicity when the available data precludes the accurate use of this terminology. With an eye to the rapidly changing nature of the labour market, including the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the role of women in the workforce, we emphasize research conducted in this area in the past decade. In so doing, we offer insights into the underemployment of racialized immigrant women in Canada today.   To begin to rectify the labour market barriers faced by racialized immigrant women, this report also identiﬁes both federal and provincial policies and policy recommendations designed to improve their labour market outcomes. In so doing, we ﬁnd gaps in available policies and programs and identify challenges in evaluating their successes. We also brieﬂy preview international policy research to shed light on some best practices to improve the labour market outcomes of racialized immigrant women.",2021,2023-05-12 15:41:26,2023-05-12 15:43:40,,55,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada",,en,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\EUCVDKQD\Momani et al. - 2021 - KNOWLEDGE SYNTHESIS REPORT ON CANADA’S RACIALIZED .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Au niveau de la fréquentation universitaire de premier cycle au Québec, nous observons une surreprésentation des étudiants provenant de milieux plus aisés. Nos résultats suggèrent également que le taux de diplomation des étudiants au baccalauréat est plus faible pour les étudiants provenant de familles à faible revenu et augmente avec le quintile de revenu parental. Notre analyse de la mobilité intergénérationnelle, à l’aide d’une matrice de transition, suggère que les jeunes diplômés universitaires ont une assez bonne mobilité relativement à la population comprenant tous les niveaux de scolarité, et que les étudiants provenant de milieux moins favorisés ont une mobilité nettement supérieure à leur population de référence. Nous calculons aussi, par université et domaine d’études, une mesure de mobilité intergénérationnelle qui tient compte de l’accès aux études universitaires et de la mobilité ascendante (passer du quintile inférieur de revenu au quintile supérieur). On constate que la mobilité ascendante varie d’une université à l’autre, mais également par domaine d’études, les institutions spécialisées en ingénierie et les programmes en science, technologie, ingénierie et mathématiques démontrant les mobilités ascendantes les plus élevées.

In response, governments in many countries have designed social programs to provide resources to families with young children. These take various forms including targeted means-tested cash transfers, in-kind transfers, vouchers for services, or services themselves. Which of these alternatives is the most successful at reducing child poverty while at the same time being affordable remains an open question. This paper attempts to answer this question by examining the effect of the introduction of the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) on child poverty and family labour supply. Our analysis indicates that there was a decline in poverty, with much of the relative decline being confined to a reduction in the poverty rate of single mothers. However, this appears to be due to an increase in poverty in single women without children. We find no evidence of a labour supply response to either of the program reforms on either the extensive or intensive margin.",2022,2023-05-12 15:06:34,2023-05-12 15:09:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,BC Basic Income Panel,,en,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\FI9UXBST\Baker et al. - Evaluating the Canada Child Benefit.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Gender Gap and the Uptake of Flexible Work,,,,,https://hdl.handle.net/1807/111100,"Flexible work arrangements (such as remote work, variable scheduling, variable work hours and shorter work weeks or hours) have been identified by researchers as a remedy to the pressures of traditional gender roles (such as child rearing and housekeeping) that make it harder for female workers to reach equity with their male counterparts.     However, as our report notes, although women disproportionally bear the brunt of work/life responsibilities, they report having less flexibility than men in changing the rate at which they work, as well as their working hours. This lack of flexibility is more pronounced for women with young or several children.     Traditionally these pressures have resulted in women being over-represented in the accommodation and food services industry. Unfortunately, this industry has also been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.    Canada may therefore have an unprecedented opportunity to expand employment opportunities for women by taking advantage of the widespread changes to work arrangements as a result of COVID-19.    Our report provides a roadmap for policymakers and employers with multiple recommendations to extend options for flexible work across all industries. These include having employers implement a “trust-based” model to evaluate their employees on their output instead their hours, and creating informal networking opportunities for remote workers.",2022-03,2023-05-12 14:56:32,2023-05-12 14:57:13,2023-05-12 14:56:32,,,,,,,Flexible Enough?,,,,,,,en_ca,,Policy Report,,,tspace.library.utoronto.ca,,Accepted: 2022-04-18T13:45:26Z,,C:\Users\Grant\Zotero\storage\PI47YNB5\Saleem et al. - 2022 - Flexible Enough The Gender Gap and the Uptake of .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enfin, malgré ce rattrapage et ce ren versement de tendance, les différences dans les choix disciplinaires et de profession des femmes et des hommes se sont cristallisées. À l’aide de diverses données statistiques nationales et internatio nales, les auteurs de cet ouvrage analysent non seulement l’évolution de ces phénomènes, mais ils tentent d’en expliquer les causes pro fondes ainsi que leurs nombreuses conséquences économiques et sociales. Ils proposent aussi de mettre en place, de la périnatalité à l’université, des mesures éprouvées pour réduire la sous-scolarisation croissante des hommes – de plus en plus néfaste dans une société de la connaissance et une économie du savoir –, tout en continuant d’encourager la performance scolaire des femmes. Enfin, toujours de façon mesurée et réfléchie, ils remettent en cause les nombreuses politiques publiques qui veulent modifier les choix disciplinaires et professionnels des femmes sans tenir compte de leurs habiletés, de leurs préférences et des contraintes diverses imposées par le marché du travail et les exigences d’une carrière réussie selon les règles du jeu actuelles.

However, the contribution of married immigrant women to the Canadian labour market was – until recently – considered of secondary importance and their labour market choices studied within a framework of temporary attachment to the labor force. Recent research, however, finds that a significant fraction of married immigrant women make labor supply decisions (and face barriers) similar to those of native-born married women. We show that this is the case in Canada as well, by estimating the progress of immigrant women over the 2000s. We use traditional measures of labour market attachment, such as participation, employment and wages, but also novel measures of labour market dynamics, such as transitions across labour market states. Differences in transition rates can reveal higher fragility of work for immigrant women, or reveal the extent to which immigrant women respond to family income shocks – the added worker effect. Results show that immigrant women are less likely to transition into employment - more likely to transition out of employment to either unemployment or inactivity – and more likely to respond to income shocks than the Canadian born. There is evidence of a gradual convergence with years spent in Canada to the outcomes of the Canadian born, which is much slower for immigrant women than immigrant men.",2022,2023-05-16 18:00:16,2023-05-16 18:02:15,,,,,,,,,Working Paper Series,,,,Canadian Labour Economics Forum,Waterloo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLEF WP 47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
